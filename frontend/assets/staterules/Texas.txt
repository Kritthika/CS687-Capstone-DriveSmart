Introduction
The Texas Department of Public Safety, Driver License Division, is committed to creating a faster, easier, and 
friendlier driver license experience and a safer Texas. One step toward achieving these important goals is to con -
tinuously improve the Texas Driver Handbook  by providing you with accurate information on traffic laws, clear 
images of road signs, examples of common driving situations, and general safety tips. We have also included 
special tips to emphasize important information you need to know.
Although the Texas Driver Handbook  has been revised, its primary purpose remains the same: 1) to help you 
qualify for a Texas driver license, and 2) to help you become a safer driver.
The information contained in this handbook is not an official legal reference to Texas traffic laws. The informa -
tion provided is only intended to explain applicable federal and state laws you need to understand in order to 
successfully operate a motor vehicle in Texas. If you would like to know the actual language of any traffic or 
criminal laws referenced in this handbook, please refer to the Texas Transportation Code and Texas Penal Code. 
Once you receive your Texas driver license, keep this handbook as a reference on traffic safety and update it as 
needed. The Texas Legislature meets every two years and regularly makes changes to traffic laws. For the most 
current information on driver licensing, visit our website at http://www.dps.texas.gov/DriverLicense/ .

Dear Texas Resident:
Operating a motor vehicle is an important privilege and responsibility for drivers, especially 
in a state as large as Texas with more than 314,000 miles of public roadways. Tragically, every 
year in Texas, approximately 3,500 people are killed in traffic crashes and more than 15,000 are 
seriously injured. Today, more than ever, drivers must avoid distractions in their own vehicle 
while also staying alert for impaired or unsafe drivers sharing the roadway – failing to do so 
could have tragic consequences.
The goal of the Texas Department of Public Safety is to provide you with critical safety 
information about driving in Texas in an effort to keep you, your passengers and other travelers 
safe on our roadways. Please carefully review and learn the information in this handbook, and 
always be mindful of the great responsibility that goes with obtaining a driver license and 
operating a motor vehicle in Texas.
Respectfully,
Freeman F. Martin  
Colonel  
Texas Department of Public Safety

•  Texas residents who have a valid Texas driver license
•  New residents who are exchanging a valid out-of-state license have 90 days to establish residency in Texas in order to secure a 
Texas driver license.
•  Any person, while driving or operating any road machine, farm tractor, or implement of husbandry temporarily operated or 
moved on a highway is exempt from having a Texas license, unless the vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle
Nonresidents:
•  Any nonresident who is at least 16 years of age and possesses a valid driver license issued in the nonresident’s home state or 
Canadian province. Nonresidents at least 16 years of age who meet these criteria may drive a vehicle permitted to be operated 
with a Class C or Class M driver license in Texas
•  Nonresidents who are at least 18 years of age may drive any vehicle in Texas if they are legally licensed to drive such a vehicle in 
their home state or country, and the home state or country grants like recognition (reciprocity) to citizens of Texas
Military:
•  The driver of an official U.S. or state military service motor vehicle may drive a vehicle without a valid Texas 
driver license, unless the vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle
•  A nonresident on active duty in the U.S. armed forces, the member’s spouse, or dependent child who has a valid 
license issued by his/her home state
•  Any person on active military duty who holds a valid driver license issued by the U.S. armed forces in a foreign 
country may drive a motor vehicle in Texas for 90 days from the date of their return to the U.S.
•  Unless a license is suspended, cancelled, revoked or denied, a Texas driver license held by any person who 
enters or who is in the U.S. armed forces will remain valid as long as the:
-  Service continues; and
-  Person remains absent from Texas and the absence does not exceed 90 days from the date the licensee is honorably separated 
from service or returns to Texas
Types of Texas Driver Licenses
Learner License (Instruction Permit)
A learner license, also known as an instruction permit, allows a student driver to legally practice driving when accompanied by a 
licensed driver. The licensed driver must be at least 21 years of age with at least one year of driving experience, must occupy the seat 
beside the driver, and cannot be intoxicated, asleep, or engaging in any activity that prevents observation and response to the actions 
of the driver. A learner license will indicate “Learner License” on the front of the card and expire on the minor’s 18th birthday. A 
person applying for a learner license must:
1.  Be at least 15 but no more than 18 years of age
2.  Complete the classroom portion of a driver education course, vision exam, and knowledge exam
3.  Meet all other requirements for a first time driver license (original) applicant
Table 1: Learner License
Minimum Age Fee* Expiration
15 with driver education $15 for license + $1 fee = $16 For applicants less than 18 years of age, the license expires on their 18th 
birthday
* A $1 administrative fee is included in most transactions. However, if you are completing multiple transactions at the same time, either in-person, telephone or 
online, then you will only be charged the $1 administrative fee once. A $1 administrative fee is not charged for transactions made through the mail.
Applicants 18 years of age and older who wish to legally practice driving are issued a Class C license with the same restrictions as 
a learner license. The license is generally valid for eight years and costs $32 plus a $1 administrative fee. 
Verification of Enrollment and Attendance (VOE) Form 
If you are under 18 years of age and applying for your first Texas driver license, learner license, or provisional license, you must 
provide evidence that you:
1
 Special Note: Special Note:
You may not receive 
a Texas driver 
license until all valid 
driver licenses and 
IDs issued are 
surrendered.
Chapter 1: Your License to Drive Texas Driver Handbook1.  Have obtained a high school diploma or its equivalent; or
2.  Are a student enrolled in a public, private, or home school and attended school for at least 80 days in the fall or spring semester 
preceding the date of application; or
3.  Have been enrolled for at least 45 days and are enrolled at the time of application in a program to prepare individuals to pass 
the high school equivalency exam.
This information is included on the Verification of Enrollment and Attendance (VOE) form issued by your school. Ask your school 
officials to complete and sign the VOE form. The VOE may not be dated more than 30 days before the date of application for a 
license during the school year or more than 90 days during the summer. The VOE must be presented to the license and permit spe -
cialist (LPS) when applying for an original or first time license.
Hardship License
A hardship license (previously known as Minor Restricted Driver License or MRDL) may be issued to a minor who establishes the 
necessity to drive and may have restrictions based on the qualifying hardship. 
An application for a hardship license (DL-77) must be executed by an authorized adult on behalf of the minor. Both the adult and 
the minor must sign the form and present it in person at the driver license office. Only a parent, guardian, or person having custody 
of a minor may apply on behalf of a minor. If the minor does not have a parent, guardian, or custodian, then an employer or county 
judge may apply on behalf of the minor.
A person applying for a hardship license must:
1.  Be at least 15 years of age but not more than 18
2.  Complete and pass a driver education course (a driver education course includes both the classroom and behind the wheel 
phase), vision, knowledge, and driving exams
3.  Meet all other requirements for a first-time driver license (original) applicant.
For more information, please visit our website, https://www.dps.texas.gov/DriverLicense/teenDriver.htm.
DPS may require supporting documentation or conduct an investigation to confirm the information provided on the application.
DPS will issue a hardship license if it is determined that:
1.  Failure to issue the hardship license will result in an unusual economic hardship for the family of the minor applicant
2.  The hardship license is necessary due to an illness, disability, or death of a family member
3.  The hardship license is necessary because the minor applicant is enrolled in a vocational education program that requires a 
license for participation
4. A court order requiring the issuance of the hardship license is presented
Graduated Driver License (GDL)
Teenagers and young adults have the highest crash rates of all drivers, and motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for 
U.S. teens. Young drivers make up 6.5 percent of the driving population but are responsible for 13 percent of fatal crashes. The 
Graduated Driver License (GDL) program eases teens into the driving experience by phasing in driving privileges and minimizing 
exposure to high-risk situations.
The GDL program applies to driver license applicants under 18 years of age and has contributed to a decrease in fatal crashes. As 
a part of this program, all new driver license applicants are required to pass a driving exam conducted at a driver license office or 
authorized testing facility.
The GDL program consists of two phases. Phase One applies to learner licenses. Phase Two applies to provisional licenses. All 
drivers less than 18 years of age must meet the licensing requirements for a learner license or provisional license, but they are also 
subject to additional requirements, including driver education and the GDL program.
Phase One:  This phase requires applicants under 18 years of age to hold a valid learner, hardship, or combination of learner and 
hardship license for a minimum of six months prior to the issuance of a provisional license. 
If your license is suspended during Phase One, then the initial six-month period is extended by the number of days of the suspension 
because your license is invalid during the suspension period.
A Texas learner license will be issued to new Texas residents who are at least 15 years of age, present an out-of-state instruction 
permit, and submit a VOE form. A Texas learner license must be held for six months from the date of issuance before the individual 
is eligible for Phase Two.
Phase One requirements do not apply to Class M (motorcycle) licenses. Under the GDL program, there is no minimum time a person 
must hold a restricted motorcycle license before applying for a Class M license.
Phase Two:  Phase Two restricts the driving privileges of individuals until their 18th birthday following the issuance of a provisional license. 
2
Chapter 1: Your License to Drive Texas Driver HandbookDuring Phase, Two these individuals may not drive a motor vehicle:
1.  With more than one passenger in the vehicle under the age of 21 who is not a family member
2.  Between midnight and 5:00 a.m. unless the operation of the vehicle is necessary for the driver to work, to attend or participate in 
a school-related activity, or due to a medical emergency
All drivers who are under 18 years of age are restricted from using a wireless communication device, including a hands-free device, 
except in case of an emergency.
Provisional License
A provisional license is a driver license issued to persons 16 to 18 years of age that has the Phase Two GDL driving restrictions applied. The 
license will be marked “PROVISIONAL” and expire on the license holder’s 18th birthday. A person applying for a provisional license must:
1.  Be at least 16 but not more than 18 years of age
2.  Complete and pass a driver education course (a driver education course includes both the classroom and behind the wheel 
phases), vision, and driving exams
3.  Have held a valid learner, hardship, or combination of learner and hardship license for at least six months
4.  Meet all other requirements for a renewal driver license applicant
Out-of-State License Holders
Applicants who are at least 15 but less than 18 years of age and present a valid out-of-state instruction permit will be issued a Phase 
One learner license. Applicants who are at least 16 but less than 18 years of age and present a valid out-of-state driver license will 
be issued a Phase Two provisional license with passenger and time restrictions after successful completion of the driving exam. 
Applicants must meet all other requirements for a first-time (original) applicant.
All licenses issued to persons less than 21 years of age will be marked “UNDER 21”.
Classes of Driver Licenses
Class A, B, C, and M driver licenses are issued to individuals who are exempt from obtaining or not required to obtain a commercial 
driver license (CDL). Most non-commercial driver licenses issued to persons 18 years of age and older are valid for eight years and cost 
$32 (a $1 administrative fee will be added to in-person , telephone and online transactions). Some applicants receive licenses with shorter 
terms due to restrictions including, but not limited to, verification of lawful presence, sex offender registration requirements, or being 
85 years of age or older.
Individuals who operate any of the following vehicles are exempt from obtaining a CDL but may need a Class A or 
Class B non-commercial driver license because the type of vehicle driven still meets the definition of a commercial mo -
tor vehicle. For more information on commercial motor vehicles and requirements for a CDL, please visit our website, 
http://www.dps.texas.gov/DriverLicense/CommercialLicense.htm  or see the Texas Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers Handbook .

Application for an occupational license is made to the district, county, or justice of the peace court in the precinct or county of the 
licensee’s residence or to the court of original jurisdiction, whichever is applicable. If the court determines an individual is eligible 
for an occupational license, then a court order will be issued. The court order authorizes DPS to issue the occupational license. The 
applicant must submit the court order and all required items to DPS before an occupational license can be issued. The fee for this 
type of license is $10 for one year or $20 if authorized for two years. The court order may be used for 45 days for driving purposes 
while the occupational license is being processed. After 45 days, you must have both the court order and the occupational license in 
your possession.
A person issued an occupational license must also carry a certified copy of the court order when operating a vehicle and must allow 
a law enforcement officer to examine the order at the officer’s lawful request. An occupational license may not be issued to drive a 
commercial motor vehicle.

Chapter 2: Vehicle Inspection and Registration Texas Driver HandbookChapter 2: Vehicle Inspection and Registration
Vehicle Inspection
All motor vehicles registered in Texas must be inspected each year at an official motor vehicle inspection station. This includes mo -
torcycles, mopeds, scooters, and autocycles. Evidence of financial responsibility for the vehicle being inspected must be presented 
at the time of the inspection. 
The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) transitioned to a new vehicle 
inspection and registration system requiring motorists to display only the valid registration sticker on the windshield. The sticker 
serves as combined proof of registration and inspection. 
When a vehicle passes inspection, the inspection station will print the passing Vehicle Inspection Report (VIR) and enter the infor -
mation into an electronic database. The DMV verifies the database information at the time your vehicle is registered. You should 
still be prepared to present the printed VIR when registering your vehicle. The VIR is only valid for 90 days from the month of 
inspection for registration purposes.

Chapter 3: Safety Responsibility Texas Driver HandbookChapter 3: Safety Responsibility
The Liability Insurance Law
The Texas Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act  was enacted to ensure all drivers are financially responsible for the death, injury, 
or property damage they may cause while operating a motor vehicle. All owners and/or operators of motor vehicles in Texas must 
have at least the minimum amount of liability insurance.
As of January 1, 2011, the minimum amount of liability insurance is:
• $30,000 against injury or death of one person
• $60,000 against injury or death of two or more individuals
• $25,000 against property damage
To comply with the Texas Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act , a driver, unless exempt, must maintain liability insurance or be 
self-insured under the provisions of the Act. Evidence of financial responsibility must be presented at the time a person applies for 
a driver license, registers a motor vehicle, or obtains a motor vehicle inspection report.
Every owner or operator of a motor vehicle in Texas is required to furnish evidence of financial responsibility to a law enforcement 
officer upon request or to another person involved in a crash.
Evidence of Financial Responsibility
The following list includes items that will be accepted as evidence of financial responsibility.
1.  A liability insurance policy in at least the minimum amounts.
2.  A standard proof of liability insurance form prescribed by the Texas Department of Insurance and issued by a liability insurer 
that includes the:
a.  Name of the insurer, insurance policy number, and policy period;
b. Name and address of each insured;
c.  Policy limits or a statement the coverage of the policy complies with at least the minimum amounts of liability insurance 
required by this Act; and
d. The make and model of each covered vehicle.
3.  An insurance binder indicating the owner and/or operator is in compliance.
4.  A certificate issued by the state comptroller showing the owner of the vehicle has on deposit with the comptroller, money or 
securities for at least $55,000.
5.  A surety bond issued by DPS showing the vehicle has a bond on file with DPS.
6.  A certificate or copy of a certificate issued by the county judge of a county in which the vehicle is registered that shows the 
owner of the vehicle has on deposit with the county judge, cash or a cashier’s check for at least $55,000.
7.  A certificate or copy of a certificate of self-insurance, issued by DPS, which shows the person has more than 25 vehicles regis -
tered in his/her name.
8.  An image displayed on a wireless communication device that includes the information required in a standard insurance form. 
Failure to Provide Evidence of Financial Responsibility
If an individual fails to provide evidence of financial responsibility when required, he/she may receive a citation. The court may 
dismiss the charge if the individual provides evidence that a liability insurance policy was in effect when the citation was issued.
Upon conviction of driving a motor vehicle without sufficient evidence of financial responsibility as required, a driver is subject 
to penalties.
Table 13: Penalties for Driving Without Evidence of Financial Responsibility
Conviction Penalty
1st conviction A fine of $175 to $350.
2nd conviction and each 
subsequent conviction Suspension of driver license, a fine of $350 to $1,000, and court-impoundment of the motor vehicle driven or 
operated by the person at the time of the offense provided the defendant was an owner of the vehicle at the 
time of the offense and is an owner of the vehicle on the date of conviction. The vehicle shall be impounded 
for 180 days. Before the court orders the release of the vehicle, evidence of financial responsibility must be 
presented to the court.

Chapter 4: Right-of-Way Texas Driver HandbookChapter 4: Right-of-Way
At times, a driver must yield to others. There are certain rules to help determine who has the right-of-way; however, if the other 
driver doesn’t follow these rules, give him/her the right-of-way. Remember, in every situation, right-of-way is something given, not 
taken. All drivers should know and understand the laws that determine who has the right-of-way.
Table 14: Penalties for Failure to Yield Right-of-Way
Offense Penalty
Driver commits any traffic offense of which failure to yield the right-of-way to another vehicle is an element 
and causes bodily injury to another.A fine of $500 to $2,000.
Driver causes serious bodily injury to another. A fine of $1,000 to $4,000.
Right-of-Way at Intersections
Intersections Controlled by Signs and Signals
When signs and signals control traffic at an intersection, you must obey them. Know the meaning of each sign 
and signal. See Chapter 5 for more information.
Single or Two-Lane Road Intersecting a Multi-Lane Road
If you are driving on a single or two lane road that intersects with a divided road or road with three (3) or more 
lanes, you must yield the right-of-way to vehicles traveling on the divided or three (3) or more lane road.
Unpaved Road Intersecting a Paved Road
If you are driving on an unpaved road that intersects with a paved road, you must yield the right-of-way to 
vehicles traveling on the paved road.
Intersections Not Controlled by Signs, Signals, Multi-Lanes, or Pavement 
When approaching this type of intersection, yield the right-of-way to any vehicle that has entered or is ap -
proaching the intersection on your right. If the road to your right is clear or if approaching vehicles are far 
enough from the intersection to make your crossing safe, you may proceed. Since there are not any traffic-
controls at this intersection, make sure there are no approaching vehicles from the left. You may legally have 
the right-of-way but be sure the other driver yields to you before you proceed.
Turning Left
When turning left, always yield the right-of-way to any vehicle coming straight through from the other 
direction.
Private Roads and Driveways
When entering or crossing a road, street, or highway from a private road, alley, building, or driveway, you must 
stop prior to the sidewalk and yield the right-of-way to all approaching vehicles and pedestrians.
T-Intersection
When approaching an intersection of a through street traveling from a street that ends at the intersection, 
you must stop and yield the right-of-way to vehicles on the through street.
20
Chapter 4: Right-of-Way Texas Driver HandbookEnter or Leave Controlled-Access Highway
The driver traveling on a frontage road of a controlled-access highway must yield the right-of-way to a vehicle:
• Entering or about to enter the frontage road from the highway; and
• Leaving or about to leave the frontage road to enter the highway.
YIELDONE-WAY FRONTAGE ROAD
YIELDYIELDYIELDTWO-WAY FRONTAGE ROAD
Driving on Multiple-Lane Roads
On a road divided into three or more lanes with traffic moving in the same direction, a vehicle entering a lane of traffic from the 
right  must yield the right-of-way to a vehicle entering the same lane of traffic from the left .
Railroad Grade Crossings
When approaching a railroad grade crossing, stop between 15 and 50 feet from the nearest rail if:
1.  A clearly visible railroad signal warns of an approaching train
2.  A crossing gate is lowered or a flag person warns of an approaching train
3.  A driver is required to stop by an official traffic-control device or a traffic-control signal
4.  An approaching train is within about 1,500 feet of the crossing. The train will produce an audible signal to identify the immedi -
ate hazard. 
5.  An approaching train is visible and in close proximity to the crossing
21
Chapter 4: Right-of-Way Texas Driver HandbookYou are required to stop at a railroad grade crossing and remain stopped until allowed to proceed or it is safe to proceed.
A person who fails to obey the law regarding railroad grade crossings is subject to a fine of $50 to $200.
Additional Safe Driving Procedures at Railroad Crossings
1.  If a railroad crossing is marked only with a cross-buck sign or reduce speed sign, then look both ways, and listen for a whistle. 
If a train is approaching, stop. If a train is not approaching, proceed with caution.
2.  If red lights are flashing at a railroad crossing, stop. If a train is approaching, remain stopped until the train passes and the lights 
stop flashing.
3.  If the railroad crossing gates have been lowered, stop. Remain stopped and wait until the train passes and the gates are raised 
before crossing.
4.  Be sure the tracks are clear before you proceed to cross. There may be two or more sets of tracks. One train could be blocking 
the view of another.
5.  Never stop on the tracks. If your car stalls on the tracks and you cannot restart it, get out and try to push the car off the tracks. 
If you cannot push the car off the tracks, get help. If a train is approaching and your vehicle is stalled, get out quickly and move 
away from the tracks. Run toward the approaching train to the side of the tracks and avoid flying debris. 
6.  Remember, trains do not and cannot stop at crossings. Trains always have the right-of-way.
7.  Audible signs or whistles may be difficult to hear when approaching railroad crossings. Roll your windows down, turn your 
radio down, and listen carefully.
If you encounter a railroad grade crossing signal problem, call the Texas Department of Public Safety Communications Center 
at (800) 772-7677 or call your local police department or county sheriff’s office. Each railroad crossing signal has an identifying 
number. Please note the number and be ready to provide it when reporting a problem.
Highway-Rail Grade Crossings Emergency Notification System (ENS)
The mission of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is to enable the safe, reliable 
and efficient movement of people and goods for a strong America, now and in the future.
In Case of Emergency 
•  Locate the blue and white Emergency Notification System (ENS) sign at the grade 
crossing. 
•  Call for help! Call the railroad’s emergency contact number listed on the blue sign. 
•  Communicate your location, by providing the identification number (see below) and 
state the nature of the emergency to the dispatcher.
The ENS sign includes: Emergencies and safety concerns at the grade crossing should 
be reported by using the information on the ENS sign.

Yield the Right-of-Way to Pedestrians (Persons on Foot)
Avoid Turning a Car into a Deadly Weapon
You should always be on the lookout for individuals who are on foot (pedestrians) whether they have the right-of-way or not. Drivers 
must give the right-of-way to pedestrians:
1.  At an uncontrolled intersection (there are not any traffic signs or signals for the pedestrian to enter the crosswalk)
2.  If the pedestrian has a WALK signal or
a.  If there is not a pedestrian control signal, give the pedestrian the right-of-way on a green light. 
b. If the light changes after the pedestrian has entered the crosswalk, still give the pedestrian the right-of-way.
Yield Here to Pedestrian Signs
The “Yield Here to Pedestrians” sign is used when yield lines are used in advance of a marked crosswalk that 
crosses an uncontrolled multi-lane roadway.
In-Street and Overhead Pedestrian Crossing Signs
The “In-Street Pedestrian Crossing” signs or the “Overhead Pedestrian Crossing” signs may be used to remind road 
users of laws regarding right-of-way at a pedestrian crosswalk without signals.
The “In-Street Pedestrian Crossing” signs are placed in the road at the crosswalk location on the center line, on a lane line, or on a 
median island. The “In-Street Pedestrian Crossing” signs will not be posted on the left- or right-hand side of the road.
23
Chapter 4: Right-of-Way Texas Driver HandbookThe “Overhead Pedestrian Crossing” signs are placed over the roadway at the crosswalk.
Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons
A pedestrian hybrid beacon is a special type of pedestrian activated warning device used with signs and pavement markings to warn 
and control traffic at locations where pedestrians enter or cross a street or highway. Pedestrian hybrid beacons are only installed at 
a marked crosswalk.

Chapter 5: Signals, Signs, and Markers Texas Driver HandbookChapter 5: Signals, Signs, and Markers
Traffic Signals
Traffic signals help provide for the orderly movement of traffic. Drivers must obey these signals, except when a law enforcement 
officer is directing traffic. You must obey a law enforcement officer at all times when they are directing traffic even if he/she is 
telling you to do something which is ordinarily considered against the law.
Steady Red Light (Stop)
Stop before entering the crosswalk or intersection. You may turn right unless prohibited by law. You may also 
turn left if both streets are one way, unless prohibited by law. You must yield to all pedestrians and other traffic 
lawfully using the intersection.
A Flashing Red Light
Stop completely before entering the crosswalk or intersection, then proceed when you can do so safely. Vehicles 
on the intersecting road may not have to stop.
Steady Yellow Light (Caution)
A steady yellow light warns drivers to use caution and to alert them the light is about to change to red. You must STOP 
before entering the nearest crosswalk at the intersection if you can do so safely. If a stop cannot be made safely, then 
you may proceed cautiously through the intersection before the light changes to red.
A Flashing Yellow Light
A flashing yellow light warns drivers to slow down and proceed with caution. 
A Flashing Yellow Arrow For Left-Turns
A flashing yellow arrow allows a driver to turn left, but the driver must yield the right-of-way to  
oncoming traffic.
Steady Green Light (Go)
A steady green light means the driver can proceed on a green light if it is safe to do so. You may drive straight 
ahead or turn unless prohibited by another sign or signal. Watch for cars and pedestrians in the intersection. Be 
aware of reckless drivers who may race across the intersection to beat a red light.
Green Arrow Displayed at the Same Time as a Red Light
A green arrow displayed at the same time as a red light means the driver can proceed carefully in the  
direction of the arrow after yielding the right-of-way to other vehicles and pedestrians.
Left Turn on Green
You can turn left on a green light. However, you must yield the right-of-way to all traffic that is approaching from the 
opposite direction before turning.
Traffic Signs
Traffic signs can help you to be a better driver because they:
1.  Warn of hazards ahead that are difficult to see
2.  Guide drivers to their destination by identifying the route
3.  Inform of local regulations and practices
4.  Regulate the speed and movement of traffic

Warning Signs
Warning signs alert drivers to conditions that are immediately ahead and tell them what to look for. There may be road hazards, 
changes in direction, or some other situation you should know about. Not only must warning signs be observed for safety reasons 
but to disregard them may be a traffic violation.
When you encounter a warning sign:
1.  Pay attention
2.  Follow instructions
3.  Reduce speed to at least the posted speed signs

with vehicles traveling in the same direc -
tion, slower traffic should travel in a lane 
other than the farthest left lane. The 
farthest left lane is for passing only.
The center lane is only used for vehicles 
turning left, and should never be used for 
passing or moving through traffic. The 
only time a vehicle should enter the center 
lane is at a point where the vehicle will 
have time to slow down or stop to make a 
safe left turn. 
A green signal will indicate when you may 
turn left. 
Vehicles driving in the right lane must turn 
right at the next intersection unless the 
sign indicates a different turning point.
Advisory Speed Sign: This sign gives the 
highest speed at which you can safely 
travel around the turn ahead.

Chapter 5: Signals, Signs, and Markers Texas Driver HandbookGuide Signs
Guide signs are especially helpful when you are not familiar with an area. Guide signs tell you what road you are on and help you 
arrive at your destination safely. The table below provides examples of common guide signs.
Table 20: Guide Signs 
Railroad Warning Signs
Railroad Crossing
This sign means you are within a few hundred feet of a railroad crossing. Slow down and be prepared to stop. If you see 
a train coming, STOP. Never try to beat a train.  
Railroad Crossbuck
Railroad crossbuck signs are posted at every railroad, highway, road, or street grade crossing and show the location of 
the train tracks. If more than one track is to be crossed, the sign will show the number of tracks. Always slow down, 
look, listen, and be prepared to yield the right-of-way to an approaching train. 
Emergency Notification System
Emergency Notification System signs are posted so the public may report unsafe situations and for railroads 
to respond to malfunctioning warning signals, vehicles stalled on the tracks or other emergency situations. 
Posted on each sign are an emergency contact number and U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) 
National Crossing Inventory Number. The inventory number identifies the exact location of the crossing. Sign Description
The only place where you may lawfully 
throw your trash on the highway is in a 
litter barrel. This sign advises that such a 
barrel is one mile ahead. Litter barrels are 
also found at all rest/picnic areas.
Texas Route Marker signs tell you what 
road you are or will be traveling on. Plan 
your trip and know which road you want 
to take.
Interstate Route Marker signs tell you 
what road you are on. Plan your trip and 
know which roads you want to take.
These signs are usually mounted above 
the road. The arrows indicate the lane 
or lanes to be used to follow a particular 
highway route.
Mileposts provide a means of identifying 
the location of crashes, breakdowns, or 
other emergencies. Mileposts are erected 
every mile on interstate highways.Sign Description
The lane that has this sign above it exits 
ahead.
This sign tells you what road you are on. 
It is a short state highway in a city or 
urban area.
Indicates an officially designated highway 
that branches off the regularly numbered 
highway and goes through the business 
portion of the city.
Travel information: This sign tells you 
which way to go and how far you must 
travel to get to cities, airports, and other 
destinations.
Lane-use control signals are overhead 
signals indicating if motorists should drive 
in a specific lane. If a red X appears above 
a lane, a driver should not drive in that 
lane. A steady yellow X means a driver 
should prepare to safely vacate the lane 
over which the signal is located because 
a lane control change is being made. A 
steady downward green arrow means 
a driver is permitted to drive in the lane 
over which the arrow signal is located. 
Lane-use control signals can be used on 
streets or highways.

Chapter 5: Signals, Signs, and Markers Texas Driver HandbookGate and Flashing Light
Stop when the lights begin to flash before the gate lowers across your side of the road.  
Remain stopped until the gates are raised and the lights stop flashing.
At railroad crossings stop within 15 feet to 50 feet of the nearest rail when:
1.  You are directed to do so by a flag person
2.  There are flashing red lights or warning bells sounding
3.  There is any warning device telling you a train is coming
Pavement Markings
Pavement markings help you just like signs and signals. They are used to warn and direct drivers and to regulate traffic.
Two-Lane Rural Road with Two-Way Traffic
Keep to the right of the yellow center line. You may cross a broken line when passing another vehicle or when the right half of the 
road is closed. Do not cross the line if it is not safe or it is a solid yellow line.
Three Lane One-Way Roads
When each lane on a one way road is marked with a broken white line, you may drive in any lane. When turning from a one-way 
road, make sure you move into the lane closest to the turn you are going to make well in advance of your turn.
Left Turn Lane Only
The only time a vehicle should enter the center lane is at a point where the vehicle will have time to slow down or stop in order to 
make a safe left turn maneuver.
                                    Left Turn Lane Only
Multi-lane Highway (Four or More Lanes)
Do not cross the double yellow line to pass. Stay in your lane as much as possible. If you are driving slower, keep in the right-hand 
lane.

Chapter 5: Signals, Signs, and Markers Texas Driver HandbookSolid and Broken Lines
A solid yellow line on your side of the road marks a “no-passing zone.” Broken or dashed lines permit you to pass or change lanes, 
if safe.
Crosswalks
White crosswalk lines are painted across a road to indicate pedestrian crossing areas. Pedestrians should use these areas when cross -
ing the road. At intersections where stop lines are missing, you must stop before the crosswalk when required to stop by traffic signs, 
traffic signals, or pedestrians in the crosswalk.
White Stop Lines
White stop lines are painted across the pavement lanes at traffic signs or signals. Where these lines are present, you are required to 
stop behind the stop line.
Solid Lines
Solid white lines are used for pavement edge lines, shoulder markings, channelizing, transitions, and lane use control. Crossing a 
solid white line should be avoided if possible. The solid yellow line on the left edge of the road is a guide for drivers to indicate driv -
ing to the left of the yellow line is prohibited. This type of yellow line can be found on interstate highways.
Crossing is prohibited where there is a pavement marking of double solid white lines.

Chapter 5: Signals, Signs, and Markers Texas Driver HandbookBarrels
Barrels that are engineered to act as an impact cushion reduce the seriousness of crashes. These barrels are usually installed in front 
of a solid obstacle and in areas of high crash frequency.
Hearing Impaired
If you see this flag on the back of a bicycle, slow down, as the bicycle operator may be hearing impaired. This sign may also be 
displayed on vehicles to alert others the driver may be hearing impaired.
Construction and Maintenance Devices
Various traffic control devices are used in construction and maintenance work areas to direct drivers, bicyclists, 
or pedestrians safely through the work zone and to provide for the safety of the workers.
The most commonly used traffic control devices are signs, barricades, vertical panels, drums, cones, tubes,  
flashing arrow panels, and flag individuals. Orange is the basic color for these devices.
When you are in a construction and maintenance work area, be prepared:
1.  To slow down or stop as you approach workers and equipment
2.  To change lanes
3.  For unexpected movements of workers and equipment
Construction and Maintenance Signs
Construction and maintenance signs are used to alert drivers of unusual or potentially dangerous conditions in or near work areas. 
Most signs in work areas are diamond shaped, but a few are rectangular.

Chapter 5: Signals, Signs, and Markers Texas Driver HandbookChannelizing Devices
Barricades, vertical panels, drums, cones, and tubes are the most commonly used devices to alert drivers of unusual or potentially 
dangerous conditions in highway and street work areas, and to guide drivers safely through the work zone. At night channelizing 
devices are often equipped with flashing or steady burn lights.
When you encounter any type of channelizing device:
1.  Slow down and prepare to change lanes when it is safe to do so.
2.  Be prepared for drivers who wait until the last second to move to the open lane.
3.  Maintain reduced speed until you clear the construction area. There should be a sign indicating you are leaving the construction 
area.
4.  Return to the normal driving lane only after checking traffic behind you.
Passing Traffic
The diagonal stripes on the barricade or vertical panel guide the driver towards the direction to where the traffic is to pass.
Pass to the Right  
Stripes sloping downward to the right means the driver should bear to the right.
Pass to the Left
Stripes sloping downward to the left means the driver should bear to the left.
Flashing Arrow Panels
Large flashing or sequencing arrow panels may be used in work zones day and night to guide driv -
ers into certain traffic lanes and to inform them part of the road ahead is closed.
Flag Person
A flag person is often provided in roadway work zones to stop, slow, or guide traffic safely through the area. A flag person wears an 
orange vest, shirt, or jacket and uses stop/slow paddles or red flags to direct traffic through work zones.
1.  A flag person is used in cases of extreme hazard.
2.  A flag person’s instructions must be obeyed.
3.  When instructed to stop, do so in your lane and do not veer right or left.
4.  Do not attempt to go forward until the flag person instructs you to do so.
5.  Proceed with caution, expect the unexpected.
6.  Always be on the lookout for oncoming vehicles in your lane of traffic.
STOPSLOWSLOW
Automated Flagger Assistance Device (AFAD)
An automated flagger assistance device (AFAD) is used to control road users through temporary traffic zones. An AFAD is designed 
to be remotely operated, allowing a flag person to be positioned out of the lane of traffic. Temporary traffic control in roadway work 
zones can also include pilot/escort vehicles, advanced warning signs, or temporary traffic signals.

Chapter 5: Signals, Signs, and Markers Texas Driver HandbookObey Warning Signs and Barricades
It is a violation to disobey the instructions, signals, warnings, or markings of a warning sign, or to drive around a barricade.
The offense is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $1 to $200. Fines double in a construction or maintenance work zone when 
workers are present anywhere in the construction zone.
The offense is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $2,000 and/or up to 180 days in jail when a warning sign or 
barricade has been placed at a location where water is over any portion of a road, street, or highway.
Slow-Moving Vehicle Emblem
This emblem is required for all slow-moving vehicles. Slow-moving vehicles are those designed to operate at a maximum speed of 
25 mph or less, and the term includes all vehicles, farm and other machinery, and any other road machinery drawn by either animals 
or slow moving motor vehicles.
a.  The use of this emblem is prohibited on anything other than a slow-moving vehicle. It must not be used on other vehicles or on 
stationary objects.
b.  Exceptions. The following do not need the special emblem:

Chapter 6: Signaling, Passing, and Turning Texas Driver HandbookChapter 6: Signaling, Passing, and Turning
Signaling
A good driver always lets others know if he/she is going to turn or stop. Signaling communicates your intention when driving and 
helps other drivers around you to plan ahead. A surprise move often results in a crash. Always be alert, watch for others, and give 
signals for your movements.
Always signal when you are going to:
1.  Change lanes
2.  Make a turn
3.  Pull away from a parking space parallel to the curb
4.  Slow down or stop
5.  Enter or leave a highway
6.  Pull over to the side of the road
How to Signal
You may either use turn signal lights or hand and arm signals.  If using hand signals, extend your hand and arm well out of the car 
window as shown below. Always make sure your signals can be easily seen by others, and signal in plenty of time.
Hand and arm signals are usually difficult to see during non-daylight hours, so it is important to make sure your signal lights are 
working properly. When signaling a stop, pump your brakes a few times to attract attention.
Signal continuously for at least 100 feet before turning or stopping, and be sure to turn off your signal lights once your turn is com -
plete. Your unintended signal still means “turn” to other drivers.
 Left Turn Right Turn Stop or Slow Down
Passing
Keep to the Right
Never drive on the left side of the road when:
1.  Pavement markings or signs prohibit driving on the left (a “No Passing Zone” or solid lane lines)
2.  There are two or more traffic lanes in each direction
3.  Within 100 feet of or crossing an intersection or railroad crossing
4.  On a hill, curve, or any other place where vision is limited
5.  Within 100 feet of a bridge, viaduct, or tunnel
Always keep to the right side of the road except when:
1.  Passing another vehicle on a two- or three-lane street
2.  Driving on a one-way street
3.  The right side of the road is blocked
Basic Safety Rules When You Are Passing
It is not always safe to pass. Be patient and wait until the time is right. Crashes resulting from improper passing often result in head 
on crashes and can be deadly.
1.  Make certain the way is clear.
2.  Give the proper signal before changing lanes.
3.  Tap your horn when necessary to avoid surprising the driver ahead.
4.  Avoid cutting in too quickly if you must return to your original lane.
38
Chapter 6: Signaling, Passing, and Turning Texas Driver HandbookHow to Pass on a Two-Lane Road
1.  Keep enough distance between you and the car in front of you so you can see ahead clearly. Check the rearview mirror, your 
side mirrors, and look over your shoulder in your blind spot to make sure the roadway is clear and no other vehicles are passing 
you. Turn on your left turn signal to alert any drivers behind you. 
2.  Check well ahead for signs and pavement markings for no passing zones, and always check for oncoming traffic in the left lane. 
Be sure you have enough time and space to overtake the car ahead and return to the right lane before an approaching car comes 
within 200 feet of you.
3.  Tap your horn when necessary to alert the driver ahead.
4.  Pass on the left and do not return to the right lane until you have safely cleared the overtaken vehicle. Wait until you can see the 
car you have just passed in your rearview mirror before returning to the right lane.
5.  Turn on your right turn signal and return to the right lane. Be sure to turn your signal off after you have completed the lane 
change.
Passing on the Right
In Texas, you can pass on the right only when conditions permit you to do so safely.
1.  The road is clear of parked vehicles or other lane obstructions and is wide enough for two or more lanes in each direction.
2.  You are on a one-way road.
3.  You may pass on a paved shoulder when the vehicle you are passing is slowing or stopped on the main traveled portion of the 
highway, disabled, or preparing to make a left turn.
Do not pass on the right by driving off the paved portion of the highway.
When Another Vehicle is Passing
1.  Do not increase your speed.
2.  Stay in your lane.
3.  Safely move as far to the right as you can when being passed on the left and the lanes are not marked.
4.  Make it as safe and easy as possible for the other driver to pass you.
Blind Spot Driving
When you are passing, do not drive or linger in the other driver’s blind spot. Either pass the other driver or slow down so you are not 
in another driver’s blind spot. It is likely the other driver cannot see you if you are in or near their blind spot. 
Blind SpotBlind Spot
Turning
Turning a corner appears to be a simple operation. However, many crashes and confusion in traffic are caused by drivers who do 
not turn properly. 
Refer to the diagrams showing the correct method of making right and left turns. There are seven steps in making a safe turn.
1.  Decide before you get to the turning point. Never make a last minute turn; it is dangerous.
2.  Look behind and to both sides to see where other vehicles are before you change lanes.
3.  Move into the proper lane as soon as possible. The faster the traffic is moving, the sooner you should move into the proper lane. 
If you cannot get into the proper lane within one-half block before turning, do not turn, and continue straight ahead.
39
Chapter 6: Signaling, Passing, and Turning Texas Driver Handbook4.  Give the proper turn signal at least 100 feet before you turn. If using a hand signal, hold the signal until you are close enough 
to the intersection for others to know your intention. Do not hold the signal while making the turn; you need both hands on the 
wheel.
5.  Slow down to a reasonable turning speed prior to making the turn. Don’t use the brake or clutch while turning.
6.  To properly execute the turn, stay in the proper turn lane at all times. Make the turn correctly. This will be easy if you are in the 
proper lane and proceeding slowly enough at the time you begin to turn.
7.  Finish the turn in the proper lane.
How to Make a Right Turn
1.  Signal for a lane change well ahead of the turning point. When it is safe, move your vehicle to the far right lane.
2.  Use your right turn signal and slow down at least 100 feet from the corner.
3.  Look both ways before starting to turn.
4.  Keep as close as possible to the right edge of the road.
5.  Turn using both hands on the wheel.
Incorrect right turn
How to Make a Left Turn
1.  Well ahead of the turning point, signal for a lane change. When it is safe, move into the center lane.
2.  Use the left turn signal and slow down at least 100 feet from the corner.
3.  Look in all directions before starting to turn. Stay to the right of the center line as you enter the intersection. Yield the right-of-
way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction.
4.  To complete a left turn you should turn to the right of the center line of the road into which you are turning by entering the lane 
in which you will interfere the least with other traffic. 
5.  Once you have completed your left turn, you may signal and change lanes if necessary.
Making a Left Turn From a One-Way Onto a Two-Way Street
If you are turning left from a one-way street you should turn from the left lane into the right lane, moving in the same direction. 
40
Chapter 6: Signaling, Passing, and Turning Texas Driver HandbookMaking a Left Turn From a Two-Way Onto a One-Way Street
If you are turning left onto a one-way street, enter the street in the lane in which you will interfere the least with other traffic. 
Other Turning Procedures
Watch for pavement markings and signs that:
1.  Permit turning right or left from or into two or more traffic lanes
2.  Give other special turning or lane information
41
Chapter 7: Parking, Stopping, or Standing Texas Driver HandbookChapter 7: Parking, Stopping, or Standing
Not all crashes happen while a vehicle is moving. An improperly parked vehicle may also cause a crash. When you leave your 
vehicle, turn the motor off, set the parking brake and remove the key. Be sure to look behind you for any oncoming traffic before 
opening your car door.
Do Not Park, Stop, or Stand a Vehicle
In the following situations, you should not park, stop, or allow a vehicle to stand idling:
1.  On the road side of any vehicle stopped or parked at the edge or curb of a street
2.  On a sidewalk or crosswalk
3.  Within an intersection
4.  Between a safety zone and adjacent curb or within 30 feet of a place on the curb immediately opposite the end of a safety zone
5.  Alongside or opposite of any street excavation or obstruction when stopping, standing, or parking would obstruct traffic
6.  On a bridge or other elevated structure on a highway or within a highway tunnel
7.  On any railroad track
8.  At any place where an official sign prohibits stopping
Do Not Park or Stand a Vehicle

1.  In front of a public or private driveway
2.  Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant
3.  Within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection
4.  Within 30 feet upon the approach to any flashing signal, stop sign, yield sign, or other traffic control signal located at the side 
of a road
5.  Within 20 feet of the driveway entrance to any fire station and on the side of a street opposite the entrance to any fire station 
within 75 feet of entrance
6.  At any place where an official sign prohibits parking or standing
Do Not Park a Vehicle
1. Do not park a vehicle, occupied or not, within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing.
2. Do not park a vehicle at any place where an official sign prohibits parking.
Parking, Stopping, or Standing on a Highway Outside an Urban Area
Never park or leave a vehicle to stand idling on the paved part of any highway outside of a business or residential district when you 
can park off the road. If you cannot park off the road:
1.  Leave plenty of room for others to pass
2.  Be sure your vehicle can be seen for at least 200 feet from each direction
3.  If at night, use your parking lights or leave your headlights on dim 
4.  A person may stop, stand, or park a bicycle on a sidewalk if the bicycle does not impede the normal and reasonable movement 
of pedestrian or other traffic on the sidewalk.
Disabled Parking
It is a violation for a person to park, stand, or stop a vehicle in a parking space designated as disabled parking. Illegally parking in 
a space reserved for individuals with disabilities is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $500 to $750 for the first offense. This 
fine increases with additional offenses up to $1,250 for five or more offenses. Additional offenses also include community service.

 Special Note: Special Note:
Temporarily 
stopping to obey 
signs, signals, etc. 
is not considered 
parking or standing.
Chapter 7: Parking, Stopping, or Standing Texas Driver HandbookTexas law specifically states:
1.  You may not park in a disabled parking space unless the vehicle has a disabled license plate or state issued removable windshield 
identification card.
2.  You may not use a disabled parking windshield identification card unless transporting the disabled person to whom it was 
issued.
3.  You may not lend your windshield identification card to someone else.
4.  You may not block an access or curb ramp.
5.  You may not make, sell, possess, or display a counterfeit disabled parking windshield identification card, or alter a disabled 
parking windshield identification card.
Certain municipalities also prohibit stopping or standing in a disabled parking space unless a disabled parking windshield identifica -
tion card is visible or the vehicle has a disabled license plate.
                       
Do not park in striped areas adjacent to disabled parking spaces or in a striped area in front of an entrance to a business adjacent to 
a disabled parking space. Striped areas are for wheelchair lifts.
Unattended Motor Vehicle
It is illegal for any driver to permit their car to stand idling unattended without turning off the engine, locking the ignition, remov -
ing the key from the ignition, and setting the brake; and when standing on any grade, without turning the front wheels to the curb 
or side of the road.
The requirements regarding turning off the engine, locking the ignition, and removing the key do not apply to a driver who starts 
the engine by using a remote starter or other similar device that remotely starts the engine without the key in the ignition. Before the 
vehicle can be operated, the key must be placed in the ignition or must be physically present in the vehicle. 
Parallel Parking
1.  Choose a space large enough for your car to fit. Signal then stop even with the front of the car about two feet out  
from the space. To alert drivers who may be behind you be sure to signal before you pass the spot you want to parallel park in. 
2.  Make sure you will not interfere with oncoming traffic then turn your front wheels all the way to the right and back slowly 
toward the curb.

Leaving a Parking Space
Use caution when leaving any parking space and check all of your mirrors to make sure nothing is obstructing your vehicle’s path, 
especially pedestrians or children. Children often play between parked cars. Look back before and while you’re backing up. Be sure 
to use your signal to notify other drivers you are leaving your current parking spot. 
Watch for children in residential areas
Coasting
It is illegal to coast on a downgrade with the gears or transmission in neutral.

Chapter 8: Speed and Speed Limits Texas Driver HandbookChapter 8: Speed and Speed Limits
Speed
Generally, you should drive at the same speed as the main stream of traffic and always be aware of 
how fast you are traveling. You must always obey the speed limit and you should consider these best 
practices below:
1.  You should keep a safe distance between your car and the one in front of you. The faster you drive, the 
greater the distance you should keep from the car ahead of you. For speeds 30 mph or less, the minimum 
time between your car and the one in front of you is 2 seconds with good road conditions. For speeds 
above 30 mph, maintain a 4 second gap between cars during good road conditions. During periods of 
poor road conditions, allow more time. Using a four-second following interval is the best practice for a 
beginning or less experienced driver.
It takes the average person 1-1/2 seconds t o think, react and apply t he brakes. The 
following table shows how far you travel in that 1-1/2 seconds, plus how many f eet y ou 
travel while skidding to stop.Appr oximate Stopping Distances

2.  You should adjust your speed and following distance according to your physical condition and the conditions of the vehicle and 
road. If you are tired or not feeling well, do not drive. Never force yourself to drive.
3.  You should know when to slow down and increase the following distance.
a.  Slow down and increase the following distance when the road is wet. Many drivers find out too late what a small amount 
of rain can do. Roads become slippery when wet, making your car harder to control. Slow down and make sure you have 
complete control of the situation at all times.
b.  Slow down and increase the following distance when the road is crowded.
c.  Slow down and increase the following distance when your vision is limited. You should always be able to stop within the 
distance you can see ahead of your car. In the dark or in bad weather, do not over-drive your range of vision.

Chapter 8: Speed and Speed Limits Texas Driver HandbookSpeed Limits
Drivers are required to obey posted minimum and maximum speed limits. These limits are designed to provide for the orderly flow 
of traffic under normal driving conditions. During periods of heavy traffic, bad weather, low visibility, or other poor driving condi -
tions, you must adjust your speed and following distance to help avoid crashes.
The Speed Limits  table shows the maximum speed limits for all vehicles under different conditions. Drivers must also be aware cities 
and counties have the authority to change these limits. Entities that establish or alter a speed limit must establish the same speed 
limit for daytime and nighttime.

The Texas Transportation Commission, regional mobility authorities and local governments have authority to raise or lower speed 
limits based on traffic studies and other statutory requirements. Many limited access highways have speed limits of 75 up to 85 mph. 
Always be aware of and observe the posted speed limit for the roadway on which you are driving. 
Slow Down or Move Over
If an emergency medical vehicle, law enforcement vehicle, fire truck, tow truck, utility service vehicle, Texas Department of Trans -
portation vehicle (TxDOT, or other highway construction or maintenance vehicle) is stopped on the road with its lights activated (the 
lights are on or flashing), then the driver is required:
1.  To reduce his/her speed to 20 mph below the speed limit; or
2.  Move out of the lane closest to the emergency medical vehicle, law enforcement vehicle, fire truck, tow truck or a TxDOT vehicle 
if the road has multiple lanes traveling in the same direction.
There are other instances where it is important to be observant of vehicles stopped on the road. Mail, delivery, and trash-collection 
vehicles often make frequent stops in the roadway. Drivers must proceed with caution, and, if possible, change lanes before safely 
passing one of these vehicles on the road. 
Street Racing
Street racing, also known as drag racing, is illegal and can result in serious injuries or fatalities. Illegal street racers put other drivers 
at risk because races are typically held on public roads. Due to the high speeds, drivers are unable to react to common road hazards 
or other driving situations, which often results in crashes.
Illegal street racing also causes unnecessary property damage, including extensive wear on roads (due to the high-powered engines 
damaging asphalt), which requires costly repairs at the expense to the tax-payer.
Please visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/speeding  for speed 
related fatalities.
A person may not participate in:
1.  A race;
2.  A vehicle speed competition or contest;
3.  A drag race or acceleration contest;
4.  A test of physical endurance of the operator of a vehicle; or
5.  In connection with a drag race, an exhibition of vehicle speed or acceleration, or to make a speed record.
The criminal penalty for a conviction of Speed Racing ranges from a Class B misdemeanor to a second-degree felony.

Chapter 9: Some Special Driving Situations Texas Driver HandbookChapter 9: Some Special Driving Situations
Driving at night is much more dangerous than driving during the day. Many people do not see as well at night. When taking a trip, 
it is safer to drive during daylight hours. Also, never drive when you are tired.
Headlights
Slow down when driving at night and be sure you can stop within the distance lit by your headlights.
You must use your headlights beginning 30 minutes after sunset and ending 30 minutes before sunrise, or anytime when individuals 
or vehicles cannot be seen clearly for at least 1,000 feet.
Avoid looking directly into the headlights of approaching vehicles; shift your eyes down to the lower right side of your traffic lane. 
Use your low beam headlights when:
1.  Within 500 feet of an approaching vehicle
2.  Following closely (within 300 feet) behind another vehicle
3.  Driving on lighted roads
4.  Driving in fog, heavy rain, sleet, snow, or dust
If you must park on an unlighted highway at night, leave your parking lights or low beam headlights on.
Highway Driving
Freeways, toll-roads, throughways, turnpikes, and expressways are designed for maximum safety, but you must know how to use 
them properly. In Texas, a highway is defined as the width between the boundary lines of a publicly maintained way, any part of 
which is open to the public for vehicular travel.
Before Using a Highway
Plan your trip in advance so you know your entrance, direction, and exit. Make sure you and your car are in good condition. If you 
cannot or do not want to drive at or above the minimum speed limit, do not use the highway.
Entering the Highway
1.  You must yield the right-of-way to vehicles already on the highway.
2.  Enter the speed change lane, stay to the right, signal left, and when it is clear, increase your speed to merge with the flow of traffic.
Speed up when entering the freeway
Driving on the Highway
Choose the Proper Lane
1.  Use the right lane to drive at the minimum posted speed limit or below the normal flow of traffic.
2.  Use the middle or left lane if you are traveling faster than other traffic or passing other vehicles.
3.  If you plan to leave the freeway soon, change to the exit lane as soon as possible.
47
Chapter 9: Some Special Driving Situations Texas Driver HandbookObserve Specific Instructions
Observe specific instructions indicating the lane you should drive in.
Once You are in the Proper Lane
1.  Stay in the middle of your lane.
2.  Do not weave in and out of traffic.
3.  Maintain a constant speed. Keep pace with the traffic. Don’t speed up and slow down 
unnecessarily.
4.  Stay at least two seconds behind the vehicle ahead of you. In bad weather, increase the time 
to at least four seconds. Watch the cars ahead of you. Be prepared if one of the cars ahead of 
you stops suddenly.
5.  Adjust your speed to allow others to enter the highway safely.
6.  Vehicles in any lane, except the right lane used for slower traffic, should be prepared to move to another lane to allow faster 
traffic to pass.
Leaving the Highway
1.  Move into the proper lane well in advance of the exit. The greater the amount of traffic, the earlier you should move into the 
proper lane. Exit signs are usually placed at least 1,000 yards ahead of the exit.
2.  Slow down on the exit ramp so by the time you are off the highway, you are within the new, slower speed limit. 
Fight Highway Hypnosis
A condition of drowsiness or unawareness can be brought on by reduced activity and steady sounds of wind, engine, and tire hum. 
This is known as highway hypnosis. All drivers should be aware of its danger and of the methods for fighting it.
1.  Stop often. Even if you are feeling well, you should stop at least every two hours or every 100 miles. Get out of your car and 
walk around. Allow your muscles to relax.
2.  Do not drive more than eight hours per day.
3.  Keep shifting your eyes. Look at different objects; near and far, left and right. Read the road signs as you approach them. Check 
your rearview mirror.
Highway Safety Tips
1.  Keep a window open so there is always fresh air in the car to help keep you alert and awake.
2.  On bright days, wear good sunglasses. Never wear sunglasses at night.
3.  Stay out of another driver’s blind spot. Traveling where the driver ahead of you cannot see your vehicle can be dangerous. Stay 
behind or go around the other vehicle. Do not follow to the side.
4.  Avoid using a cell phone while driving; use may cause distraction and driver inattention. If you must use a cell phone, safely 
pull off the road or use a hands-free headset. If you are under 18 years of age, it is illegal to use a cell phone while driving even 
if it is a hands-free device except in the case of emergency.
Vehicle Breakdown
1.  If you can’t get the car off the road, get everyone out of the car and off the road. Portable warning devices should be used to 
warn oncoming traffic.
2.  Move your car off the pavement to the side of the road. A car with a flat tire or blowout can be driven slowly off the road.
3.  Turn on your emergency warning lights. If you do not have warning lights, use your taillights. At night, in addition to your tail -
lights and warning lights, turn the lights on inside of the car.
4.  Tie a white cloth to your radio antenna, door handle, or some other place where it may be easily seen. If you do not have a white 
cloth, raise your hood.
Controlling a Car in Special Situations
There is one basic rule which applies in all driving situations, think  before you act.
Steering Out of a Skid
An automobile skids when its tires lose their grip on the road surface. If the car starts to skid, follow these safety tips.
1.  Do not hit the brakes suddenly and hard. Take your foot off the gas pedal (accelerator).
2.  Turn your steering wheel in the direction of the skid. As you recover control, gently straighten the wheels.
4856
Metropolis
UtopiaNewportUS
EXIT1MILE24
Chapter 9: Some Special Driving Situations Texas Driver Handbook3.  Avoid a situation that could cause a skid by slowing down when the road and weather conditions are poor. Also, check your 
car’s tires. Old or worn tires that have minimal or damaged tread are dangerous. (In the illustration below, the direction of the 
skid is to the right.)
Steering out of a skid
Turn steering wheel in 
direction of skid
Brake Failure
If your car brakes fail, do not panic. Remember you can use your parking brake and shift to a lower gear. Apply your parking brake 
cautiously to keep from locking the brakes and throwing your car into a skid.
Running Off the Pavement
If something causes you to swerve and run off the pavement:
•  Do not hit the brakes suddenly and hard. Grip the steering wheel tightly and take your foot off the gas pedal.
•  Use your brakes carefully and do not swing back onto the pavement. Wait until your speed is reduced, check the traffic behind 
you, and then carefully drive back onto the pavement.
Flat Tire or Blowout
If you have a flat tire or a blowout:
•  Do not hit the brakes suddenly and hard
•  Take your foot off the gas pedal and gently apply the brakes
•  Steer straight ahead to a stop
Driving Down a Steep Hill
When driving down a steep hill, you can shift your car into a low gear to help slow your vehicle. Never coast in neutral or for cars 
with a standard transmission, never coast with your foot on the clutch.
Winter Driving
Most drivers realize winter creates additional hazards, but many drivers don’t know what to do about it. Here are a few precautions 
you should follow during winter.
Table 23: Winter Driving Safety Tips
Safety Tip Explanation
Maintain a safe 
interval Increase the distance from the vehicle ahead of you according to the conditions of the pavement. Many rear-end 
collisions occur on icy streets because drivers don’t leave space to stop. Snow tires will slide on ice or packed snow. To 
keep safe, you must keep your distance.
Reduce speed to 
correspond with 
conditionsThere is no such thing as a “safe” speed range at which you may drive on snow or ice. You must be extremely cau -
tious until you are able to determine how much traction you can expect from your tires. Avoid locking of brakes on  
ice as it will cause a loss of steering and control. Every city block and every mile of highway may be different, depend -
ing upon sun or shade and the surface of the road.
Keep windows clear Remove snow and ice before you drive, even if you’re just driving a few miles. Make certain the windshield wipers and 
defroster are working properly.
Watch for danger 
spots aheadThere may be ice on bridges when the rest of the pavement is clear. Snow melts more slowly in shady areas. Take 
precautions when approaching turns.
Get a feel for the 
roadStart out very slowly. It is useless to burn the rubber off your tires by spinning the wheels. Test your brakes gently 
after the car is in motion to determine how much traction you have. Start slowing down before you come to a turn.
Equip your vehicle 
with chains or  
snow tiresChains are the most effective and should be used where ice and snow remain on the road. One word of caution, 
neither chains nor snow tires will permit you to drive on slick pavement at normal speeds so don’t get a false feeling 
of security.
Roundabouts
Modern Roundabout
A modern roundabout is a one-way, circular intersection where traffic flows counter clockwise around a center island. Modern 
roundabouts use yield signs rather than traffic lights to control vehicles entering the intersection. This intersection design only has 
eight potential conflict points, opposed to a traditional “four-way” signalized intersection which has 32 potential conflict points.
49
Chapter 9: Some Special Driving Situations Texas Driver HandbookDriving in a Modern Roundabout
Road signs, pavement markings and its de -
sign help guide drivers through a modern 
roundabout.
To drive in a modern roundabout, follow 
these simple steps: slow down as you ap -
proach the intersection, yield to traffic 
already in the circle, enter the circle and 
follow the loop in a counter clockwise direc -
tion, and then make a right turn to exit the 
roundabout.
There are two types of modern roundabouts: 
single-lane roundabouts and multi-lane 
roundabouts. 
Single-lane roundabout: Slow down as you 
approach the roundabout intersection and 
observe any posted advisory speed signs. 
Yield to traffic driving in the circle. When there is an acceptable gap, enter the circle and travel counterclockwise around the circle. 
Make a right turn by using your turn signal when exiting the circle.
Observe traffic signs and pavement markings when navigating a roundabout. Also, look for bicyclists and pedestrians using the 
crosswalks on the roundabout approaches and exits.
Multi-lane roundabouts: Go through the same steps as a single-lane roundabout and follow these additional steps. When approach -
ing a multi-lane roundabout, observe the advance lane movement sign for choosing the correct entry lane. Also, do not change lanes 
while driving in the circle.
When navigating all roundabouts, give space for large vehicles, such as semitrailers, buses, and fire trucks that need more than one 
lane when driving around the circle. Also, pull over for emergency vehicles on the roundabout approaches and exits. However, do 
not stop for emergency vehicles in the roundabout circle. Clear the circle first and then pull over for the emergency vehicle.
Floods
Floods are one of the most common hazards in the U.S. Nearly half of all flash flood fatalities are vehicle-related.
These are the facts:
•  Six inches of water will reach the bottom of most passenger cars, causing loss of control and possible stalling.
•  Twelve inches of water will float many cars.
•  Two feet of rushing water will carry away pick-up trucks, SUVs, and most other vehicles.
•  Water across a road may hide a missing segment of roadbed or a missing bridge. Roads weaken under floodwater and drivers 
should proceed cautiously after waters have receded since the road may collapse under the vehicle’s weight.
National Weather Service and Texas Division of Emergency Management officials say if your vehicle stalls in floodwater, get out 
quickly and move to higher ground. Better yet, when there’s water on the road, Turn Around Don’t Drown®. Saving your life is as 
simple as choosing an alternate route.
There is no friction force once the vehicle is lifted off the road.  
Nearly half of all flood fatalities are vehicle related.

Chapter 9: Some Special Driving Situations Texas Driver HandbookShare the Road with Trucks (Large trucks and truck-tractor combinations)
Whether you are sharing the road with a passenger car, motorcycle, truck, bus, or other vehicle, it is important to obey traffic laws, 
abide by the rules of the road, and drive defensively. Trucks are designed to carry products to and from towns and cities; they are 
designed to be as maneuverable as cars. Trucks have longer stopping and accelerating distances, a wider turning radius, and weigh 
more.
Passing
1.  When passing a truck, first check to your front and rear, check mirrors and blind spots, then move into the passing lane only if 
it is clear and you are in a legal passing zone. Let the truck driver know you are passing by flashing your headlights, especially 
at night. The truck driver should make it easier for you to pass by staying to the far side of the lane.
2.  On a level highway, it takes three to five seconds longer to pass a truck than a car. On an upgrade, a truck often loses speed so 
it’s easier to pass than a car. On a downgrade, the truck’s momentum causes the truck to go faster so you may need to increase 
your speed. Complete your pass as quickly as possible and don’t stay alongside the other vehicle.
3.  If the driver flashes the truck’s lights after you pass, it’s a signal that it is clear for you to pull back in front of the truck. Be sure 
to move back only when you can see the entire front of the truck in your rearview mirror. After you pass a truck, maintain your 
speed.
4.  When a truck passes you, help the truck driver by keeping to the far side of your lane. You’ll make it easier for the truck driver 
if you slightly reduce your speed. Don’t speed up while the truck is passing. After passing, the truck driver should signal to let 
you know he is returning to your lane.
5.  When you meet a truck coming from the opposite direction, keep as far to the side as possible to avoid a sideswipe crash and to 
reduce the wind turbulence between the two vehicles. Remember, turbulence pushes vehicles apart; it does not pull them together.
Following a Truck
1.  Tractor-trailers take longer to stop than a car traveling at the same speed. The average passenger car traveling at 55 mph can 
stop in approximately 240 feet, which is about three-fourths the length of a football field. A fully loaded tractor-trailer may take 
more than 400 feet to completely stop, well over the length of a football field.
2.  If you’re following a truck, stay out of its blind spot at the rear. The blind spot is the area behind the truck that the driver cannot 
see in his rearview mirrors. Avoid following too closely, and position your vehicle so the truck driver can see your vehicle in 
the truck’s side view mirror. An excellent rule of thumb for motorists sharing the road with a tractor-trailer is, “If you can’t see 
the truck driver in his side mirror, he can’t see you.” By avoiding the truck driver’s blind spot, you will have a good view of the 
road ahead, and the truck driver can give you plenty of warning for a stop or a turn. This will allow you more time to react and 
make a safe stop.
3.  When you follow a truck at night always dim your headlights. Bright lights from a vehicle behind will blind the truck driver 
when the lights reflect off the truck’s large side mirrors.
4.  If you are stopped behind a truck on an upgrade, leave space in case the truck drifts back when it starts to move. Also, keep to 
the left in your lane so the driver can see you’re stopped behind the truck.
Right Turns
Pay attention to turn signals. Trucks make wide, right turns and sometimes leave an open space to the right just before the turn. To 
avoid a crash, don’t pass a truck on the right if there is a possibility the truck might make a right turn.
Backing Crashes
Never cross behind a truck preparing to back up. When a truck driver is preparing to back the truck from a road into a loading area, 
the road is temporarily blocked. Wait for the truck to complete its maneuver before trying to pass. If you pass too closely behind the 
truck, a crash may occur because you are in the truck’s blind spot.
Maneuverability
On multi-lane highways, tractor-trailers stay in the center lane to help the flow of local traffic on and off the highway. Staying in 
the center lane also increases the truck driver’s options if he/she has to switch lanes to avoid a crash. Be aware of common mistakes 
drivers should avoid when driving around trucks and buses.
Cutting Off a Vehicle to Reach Your Exit or Turn
Never cut in front of a truck. Cutting into the open space in front of a truck or bus removes the driver’s cushion of safety. Trying 
to beat a truck to a single-lane construction zone represents a particularly dangerous situation. Either slow down and exit or stay 
behind the truck.
51
Chapter 9: Some Special Driving Situations Texas Driver HandbookNever Underestimate the Size and Speed of an Approaching Tractor-trailer
Because of its large size, a tractor-trailer often appears to be traveling at a slower speed than it is. A substantial number of car and 
truck collisions take place at intersections because the driver of the car does not realize how close the truck is or how quickly it is 
approaching.
Share the Road with Motorcycles
Individuals who operate a motorcycle have the same rights and privileges as any other vehicle on the road.
For various reasons, drivers may not see the motorcyclist, and approximately one-half of all motorcycle crashes involve another 
vehicle. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, motorcyclists are about 35 times more likely to die in a 
traffic crash than passenger car occupants. A few of the most common reasons are provided below.
1.  Many drivers tend to look for other cars, not for motorcyclists.
2.  The profile of a motorcycle is much smaller than the profile of a car, making an approaching motorcyclist harder to see.
3.  Estimating the distance and speed of a motorcycle is more difficult than it is for a car.
4.  Motorcycle riding requires frequent lane movements to adjust to changing road conditions.
5. Distracted driving, such as texting or talking on a cell phone.
Situations When Crashes Are Most Likely to Occur
Motorcycle crashes are most likely to occur in the high-risk situations described below.
Left Turns
The most common crash between cars and motorcycles is at an intersection when the driver of a car is making a left turn in front 
of a motorcycle. 
A Car’s Blind Spot
Motorcyclists are often hidden in a vehicle’s blind spot or missed in a quick look due to their 
smaller size. Always make a visual check for motorcycles by checking mirrors and blind spots 
before entering or leaving a lane of traffic and at intersections.
Hazardous Road Conditions
Road conditions that are a minor annoyance to you may pose a major hazard to motorcyclists. 
Motorcyclists may suddenly change speed or adjust their position within a lane in reaction to 
changes in the weather, road, or traffic conditions. This may include potholes, gravel, railroad 
crossings, and wet or slippery surfaces which impair the motorcyclists’ braking and handling 
abilities. Expect and allow room for such actions by the motorcyclist.
Strong Winds
A strong gust of wind can move a motorcycle across an entire lane if the rider isn’t prepared for it. Wind gusts from large trucks in 
the other lane can also be a hazard.
Large Vehicles
A large vehicle such as a van, bus, or truck can block a motorcycle from a driver’s view and the motorcy -
clist may seem to suddenly appear from nowhere.
Motorcycle Driving Awareness
Look Out for Motorcyclists
Although you may not see any cars, be aware there may be a motorcycle. Be careful at intersections, and 
always take a second look for a motorcycle before turning at an intersection, particularly when making 
left turns.
Signal Your Intentions
Always signal before changing lanes or merging with traffic. This allows the motorcyclist to anticipate traffic flow and find a safe 
lane position. Signal even if you don’t see cars or motorcycles. Be careful when making left turns across lanes of approaching traf -
fic. Look carefully in all directions for approaching motorcyclists. Don’t be fooled by a flashing turn signal. Motorcycle signals 
usually are not self-canceling and riders sometimes forget to turn them off. Wait to be sure the motorcycle is going to turn before 
you proceed.
Respect a Motorcycle
Allow the motorcyclist a full lane width. Although it may seem as though there is enough room in the traffic lane for an automobile 
and a motorcycle, the motorcycle is entitled to a full lane and may need the room to maneuver safely. Do not attempt to share the 
lane with a motorcycle.
52
Chapter 9: Some Special Driving Situations Texas Driver HandbookAllow Plenty of Space When Following a Motorcycle
The slightest contact can mean a spill or injury for the rider. Allow more following distance, at least four to six sec -
onds, when following a motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver or stop in an emergency. Stop 
a safe distance behind the motorcyclist at intersections, signals, or crossings. A full vehicle length is recommended 
to help prevent impact with the motorcycle should your vehicle suffer a rear end collision. In dry conditions, motor -
cycles can stop more quickly than a car, so being aware and alert at all times can help prevent a collision.
Texas Motorcycle Operator Training Program
The Texas Legislature created the Motorcycle Operator Training and Safety program in 1983 and moved its 
administration from DPS to TDLR in 2020. The Program’s aim is  to improve rider skills and reduce the number 
and severity of motorcycle crashes in Texas. A portion of each motorcycle license fee is used to support this program. The program 
develops curriculum and monitors motorcycle training classes throughout the state and promotes motorcycle safety and awareness 
through campaigns, exhibits, and materials.
Contact TDLR at https://www.tdlr.texas.gov/  for more information about motorcycle safety and training courses.
Share the Road with Light Rail
In recent years, light rail has been established in many major cities in Texas. As you travel these areas, you may notice these trains 
move along the streets just like other vehicles. Light rail is very quiet; and, in fact, quieter than most buses and cars. So whether 
you are riding a light rail or just walking or driving near the train or tracks, it’s important to stay alert and observe the safety rules.
Table 24: Safety Rules for Light Rail
Action Description
Stop - Don’t walk in front of, between, or behind a train.  
- Trains can’t start or stop quickly regardless of traffic flow.  
- Do not drive, stop, or park your vehicle on the tracks. It’s dangerous and illegal.
Look - Cross the tracks only at designated crossings and only when it is safe.  
- Look both ways before crossing the tracks. Trains travel in both directions.  
- Obey all warning signs, flashing lights, signals, and crossing gates. A law enforcement officer will issue tickets to violators.
Listen - Stay alert. Light rail is quieter than a bus or most cars. You may not hear a light rail coming.  
- Listen for train horns and signal bells.  
- Always follow instructions from a law enforcement officer.
Don’t - Never race a train, run in front of a train, or put anything on or near the tracks.  
- Never try to beat the train to a crossing. Even in a tie, you lose.  
- Never drive around crossing gate arms.
Share the Road with Bicycles
A bicycle is a vehicle. Any person riding a bicycle has all of the rights and responsibilities as a driver of a vehicle.
Rules for Motorists and Bicyclists
1.  Bicyclists are not restricted to the right lane of traffic. One-way, multi-lane streets are one example of this. Another instance 
is when the bicyclist is changing lanes to make a left turn. The bicyclists should follow the same path any other vehicle would 
take traveling in the same direction.
2.  A motorist should merge with bicycle traffic when preparing for a right turn. Avoid turning directly across the path of bicycle 
traffic.
3.  Bicyclists are required to ride as far to the right in the lane as possible only when the lane can be shared safely by a car and a 
bicycle, side-by-side. Even then, there are certain conditions that allow a bicyclist to take the full lane.
a.  The bicyclist is overtaking and passing another, vehicle proceeding in the same direction.
b.  The bicyclist is preparing for a left turn at an intersection or onto a private road or driveway.
c.  There are unsafe conditions in the road, such as fixed or moving objects, parked or moving vehicles, pedestrians, animals, 
potholes, or debris.
d.  The lane is of substandard width, making it unsafe for a car and a bicycle to safely share the lane side-by-side. When this is 
the case, it is best for the cyclist to take the full lane, whether riding single file or two abreast.
Car-Bicycle Crashes 
Be on the lookout for cyclists on the road, especially at intersections. The most common car-bicycle crashes caused by a motorist are:
1.  A motorist turns left in front of oncoming bicycle traffic. Oncoming bicycle traffic is often overlooked or its speed misjudged.
2.  A motorist turns right across the path of the bicycle. The motorist should slow down and merge with the bicycle traffic for a 
safe right turn.
53
 Special Note: Special Note:
If you drive aware 
of motorcyclists 
in these situations, 
you can help make 
the streets and 
roads safer for 
everyone.
Chapter 9: Some Special Driving Situations Texas Driver Handbook3.  A motorist pulls away from a stop sign and fails to yield the right-of-way to bicycle cross traffic. At intersections, the right-of-
way rules apply equally to motor vehicles and bicycles.
Wrong way  
(do not cut across the 
path of a bicycle)          Turning right,
merge right!

Distracted driving
Whenever you are driving a vehicle and your attention is not on the road, you’re putting yourself, your passengers, other vehicles, 
and pedestrians in danger. Distracted driving can result when you perform any activity that may shift your full attention from the 
driving task. Taking your eyes off the road or hands off the steering wheel presents obvious driving risks. Mental activities that take 
your mind away from driving are just as dangerous. Your eyes can gaze at objects in the driving scene but fail to see them because 
your attention is distracted elsewhere.
Activities that can distract your attention include texting, talking to passengers, adjusting the radio, CD player or climate controls; 
eating, drinking or smoking; reading maps or other literature; picking up something that fell; reading billboards and other road 
advertisements; watching other people and vehicles including aggressive drivers; talking and/or texting on a cell phone or CB radio; 
using telematics devices (such as navigation systems, pagers, etc.); daydreaming or being occupied with other mental distractions.
If drivers react a half-second slower because of distractions, crashes double. Some tips to follow so you won’t become distracted:
•  Review and be totally familiar with all safety and usage features on any in-vehicle electronics, including your wireless device  
or cell phone, before you drive.
•  Pre-program radio stations.
•  Pre-load your favorite CDs or cassette tapes.
•  Clear the vehicle of any unnecessary objects.
•  Review maps and plan your route before you begin driving.
•  Adjust all mirrors for the best all-round visibility before you start your trip.
•  Do not attempt to read, text, or write while you drive.
•  Avoid smoking, eating and drinking while you drive.
•  Don’t engage in complex or emotionally intense conversations with other occupants.
You need to be able to recognize other drivers who are engaged in any form of driving distraction. Not recognizing other distracted 
drivers can prevent you from perceiving or reacting correctly in time to prevent a crash. Watch for:
•  Vehicles that may drift over the lane divider lines or within their own lane.
•  Vehicles traveling at inconsistent speeds.
•  Drivers who are preoccupied with maps, food, cigarettes, cell phones, or other objects.
•  Drivers who appear to be involved in conversations with their passengers.
Give a distracted driver plenty of room and maintain your safe following distance.
Be very careful when passing a driver who seems to be distracted. The other driver may not be aware of your presence, and they 
may drift in front of you. 
Texting While Driving
It is against the law to read, write, or send messages on a cell phone or other portable wireless device. If your cell phone rings, do 
not answer the call or respond to the text message. Convictions for violations of this law are subject to fines. 
You may use a cell phone to contact law enforcement or during an emergency. If you must make a call, pull safely off the road and 
make the call. Try to keep the conversation short, or have a passenger make the call for you, if possible.

Chapter 10: Alcohol and Drugs Impact on the Driving Ability Texas Driver HandbookChapter 10: Alcohol and Drug Impact on the Driving Ability
Any drug may affect a person’s ability to drive. Millions of people take over the counter and prescription medications, illegal drugs, 
or drink alcohol and do not realize they may affect the mental and physical (psychomotor) skills necessary to operate a vehicle and 
react to external events while driving a vehicle.
Each individual is different. The driving skills of persons taking the same drug may be affected differently. A driver’s body weight, 
emotional state, amount of drug taken, and when the drug was taken will influence the driver’s ability to assess an emergency situ -
ation or judge speed and distance. Safe driving always requires an observant eye, a steady hand, and a clear head.
When a person drinks alcohol or uses drugs, one of the first effects is they lose their judgement and their sight is impaired, causing 
slower reactions to sounds and the inability to judge another vehicle’s speed. A person’s ability to reason can all but disappear. Good 
judgment may be as simple as saying no to a friend who wants to race their car. However, if a person has been drinking alcohol or 
they are under the influence of drugs, their judgment may turn into, “Sure, take my car.” 
Taking more than one drug at the same time is even more dangerous since drugs may have a different overall cumulative effect, 
especially when alcohol is involved. Besides escalating the overall effects of the other drugs, alcohol can also mask the effects of 
those drugs, increasing a person’s risk of poor decision making and/or slowing responsive reactions to situations. You should always 
check with a doctor or pharmacist before taking more than one type of drug or mixing drugs, especially tranquilizers or sedatives. 
Table 25: Alcohol and Other Types of Drugs
Type Description
Marijuana Research shows even typical social doses of marijuana can affect concentration, judgment, and sensory and 
perceptual skills needed for careful driving. People who are under marijuana influence have impaired sensory and 
perceptual abilities.
Stimulants Heavy amphetamine use may keep drivers awake and active for long periods of time. It also makes them less 
coordinated, edgy, and more likely to be involved in a car crash. Research shows typical social amounts of cocaine 
can produce lapses in attention and concentration. While caffeine can help drowsy drivers stay alert, it can’t make 
a drunk driver sober. Studies show ordinary amounts of caffeine don’t improve a drunk driver’s ability to operate 
a vehicle.
Tranquilizers / 
Sedative-HypnoticsTranquilizers/Sedative-hypnotic drugs, including barbiturates, are powerful depressants, which calm people down 
or help them sleep. Tired or over-sedated drivers are not good drivers.
Over-the-counter drugs Many over-the-counter drugs cause drowsiness in some people, which can affect their driving. Read the labels 
and be careful with antihistamines, other cold preparations, or any medicine that relaxes or promotes sleep.
Any drug Any drug might affect your ability as a driver. If you take more than one drug or if you mix drugs, especially 
tranquilizers or other sedative-hypnotics with alcohol, you could be asking for trouble on the road and off. If you 
have doubts about a drug or drug mix, check with a doctor or pharmacist.
Alcohol Each year alcohol, a depressant drug affecting coordination, judgment, perception, and emotional state, is 
responsible for a significant number of highway deaths. Alcohol increases the depressant effects of tranquilizers 
and barbiturates. Mixing these drugs, on or off the road, can be hazardous.
The Number One Killer is Alcohol
Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) is a problem affecting all Texans. According to the Calendar Year 2018 Texas Motor Vehicle 
Traffic Crash Facts  (TxDOT), 940 persons were killed in a motor vehicle traffic crash with a driver under the influence of alcohol. 
Alcohol related crashes represent 26% of the total number of persons killed in motor vehicle traffic crashes.  
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) states that the leading cause of death for U.S. teens is accidental and most of those are motor 
vehicle crashes. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 3,255 teen (age 15 to 19) drivers were 
involved in fatal crashes in 2017 and nearly 25% of those had been drinking. 
In 2018, TxDOT reports that nearly 7% of all fatal crashes involved a driver under the age of 21 who was under the influence of 
alcohol. Texas law does not allow any amount of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) for minors. 
To make Texas safer, the Texas legislature enacted laws to deter people from drinking and driving by penalizing those who choose 
to drink and drive. In Texas, a person, age 21 and over, is considered legally intoxicated if the person has a BAC of 0.08 or more. 
Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) and Driving Under the Influence (DUI) arrests can be a humiliating experience and are costly. 
Some fines range as high as $10,000 not including the cost of a bail bondsman, attorney, or other court-required expenses. Is it worth 
the risk?
55
Chapter 10: Alcohol and Drugs Impact on the Driving Ability Texas Driver HandbookOpen Container
It is illegal to possess an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle passenger area located on a public highway, regardless of 
whether the vehicle is being operated, stopped, or parked. Conviction of this offense is punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.
Myths about Drinking Alcohol
Taking cold showers, drinking black coffee, or exercising will not make a person sober. Only time, based on body weight, number of 
drinks, and food intake can minimize the effects of alcohol. It takes about one hour for the body to rid itself of each drink consumed. 
If a person has been drinking, someone who has not been drinking should drive.
Texas Tough Alcohol-Related Laws for Minors
Zero Tolerance for Minors
According to the Texas Alcohol Beverage Code, a minor is any individual who is under 21 years of age. A minor may not purchase, 
attempt to purchase, consume, or possess an alcoholic beverage. Since a minor should not possess alcohol, Texas passed zero toler -
ance legislation for minors who commit an offense under the non-driving alcohol-related laws and for minors who drive under the 
influence.
Zero tolerance means just that. Even if a minor is not intoxicated as defined under the DWI statute, but has any detectable amount 
of alcohol in his/her system while operating a motor vehicle in a public place or while operating a water- craft, the minor committed 
the criminal offense of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol by a Minor (see Table 31).
Penalties for Non-Driving Alcohol-Related Offenses by Minors
The Texas Zero Tolerance law established penalties for minors who commit offenses under the non-driving alcohol-related offenses. 
A minor may not purchase, attempt to purchase, falsely state he/she is 21 years of age or older, or present any document indicating 
he/she is 21 years of age or older to a person engaged in the selling or serving of alcoholic beverages. A minor may not consume, or 
possess an alcoholic beverage. Persons who purchase, furnish, or sell alcohol to a minor can be fined up to $4,000 and/or confined 
in jail for up to one year.
Table 26: Penalties for Non-Driving Alcohol-Related Offenses – Minors
Offense Penalty
1st offense Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500, 8 to 12 hours of community service, mandatory 
attendance of an alcohol awareness course, and license will be suspended (or privilege denied if not licensed) for  
30 days. If the minor is under 18, the parent may be required to also attend the alcohol awareness course.
2nd offense Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500, 20 to 40 hours of community service, may be required to 
attend an alcohol awareness course, and license will be suspended (or privilege denied if not licensed) for 60 days.
3rd offense  
(Under 17 years of age)Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500, 20 to 40 hours of community service, may be required to 
attend an alcohol awareness course, and license will be suspended (or privilege denied if not licensed) for 60 days 
or case can be transferred to Juvenile Court.
3rd offense  
(17 to 21 years of age)Class B misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $250 to $2,000, 40 to 60 hours of community service, may be 
required to attend an alcohol awareness course, confinement in jail not to exceed 180 days, and license will be 
suspended (or privilege denied if not licensed) for 180 days. Minors are not eligible for deferred disposition or 
adjudication on the third conviction and every conviction after.
In addition to the above penalties, if a minor is convicted of any moving vehicle violation while suspended due to a non-driving 
alcohol-related offense (listed above) they are subject to the penalties of Driving While License Invalid (DWLI).
Implied Consent Laws for Minors
A minor implies their consent to take one or more breath or blood specimen for analysis if they are arrested for operating a motor 
vehicle or watercraft in a public place while intoxicated, or if there is any detectable or noticeable amount of alcohol in their system 
while operating a motor vehicle in a public place as deemed by an officer. The breath or blood specimen will determine if alcohol 
is present in their body. It will also identify the amount of alcohol in their system. Additionally, the breath or blood specimen can 
identify the presence of any other controlled substances or drugs. 
56
Chapter 10: Alcohol and Drugs Impact on the Driving Ability Texas Driver HandbookRefusal to provide a breath or blood specimen will result in the suspension of the minor’s license or driving privileges if not licensed.
Table 27: Penalties for Refusal to Provide a Specimen - Minors
Offense Penalty
1st offense Driver license suspended (or privilege denied if not licensed) for 180 days.
2nd and subsequent offenses Driver license suspended (or privilege denied if not licensed) for 2 years.
A minor who gives a breath or blood specimen that confirms he/she has been operating a motor vehicle in a public place with any 
detectable amount of alcohol in his/her system and the amount is below the 0.08 BAC legal limit of intoxication will have his/her 
license suspended or driving privilege denied if not licensed.
Table 28: Minor Provided Specimen Confirming Detectable Amount of Alcohol (failure)
Offense Penalty
1st offense Driver license suspended (or privilege denied if not licensed) for 60 days.
2nd offense Driver license suspended (or privilege denied if not licensed) for 120 days.
3rd and subsequent offenses Driver license suspended (or privilege denied if not licensed) for 180 days.
A minor may request a hearing before a hearing officer to contest the suspension.
Table 29: Penalties for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) of Alcohol and Drugs– Minors
Offense Penalty
1st offense Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500, community service of 20 to 40 hours, and 
attendance in an alcohol awareness course is required. If the minor is under 18, the parent may be 
required to also attend the course. 
2nd offense Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500, community service of 40 to 60 hours.  
The alcohol awareness course may be required.
3rd offense (under 17 years of age) Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500, community service of 40 to 60 hours. 
The alcohol awareness course may be required or the case can be transferred to Juvenile Court as 
delinquent conduct.
3rd offense (17 to 21 years of age) Class B misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $500 to $2,000 and/or confinement in jail not to ex -
ceed 180 days, community service of 40 to 60 hours, an alcohol awareness course may be required, 
and the minor’s license will be suspended (or privilege denied of not licensed) for one year or for 
90 days with a judge’s order to install an ignition interlock device. The court may not give deferred 
disposition or adjudication on the third offense.
See Table 29 and Table 30 for the applicable suspension periods
In Texas, as a reminder, a person is considered legally intoxicated if they have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08 or more. 
Table 30: Penalties for Driving While Intoxicated (Alcohol) – Minors
Offense Penalty
1st offense Class B misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $2,000, confinement in jail for 72 hours to 180 days, and 
suspension of the driver license (or privilege denied if not licensed) for 365 days, or for 90 days with a judge’s order 
to install an ignition interlock device. The court may probate the jail sentence and waive the license suspension on the 
first offense only. Possession of an open container of an alcoholic beverage increases the minimum confinement to six 
days.
2nd offense Class A misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $4,000, confinement in jail for 30 days to 1 year, and 
suspension of the driver license (or privilege denied if not licensed) for 180 days to 18 months.

to 2 years.
57
Chapter 10: Alcohol and Drugs Impact on the Driving Ability Texas Driver HandbookTexas Alcohol-Related Laws for Adults 
Implied Consent Laws for Adults 
The implied consent for adults is similar to that of minors. 
Like the minor, an adult implies their consent to take one or more breath or blood specimen for analysis if they are arrested for 
operating a motor vehicle or watercraft in a public place while intoxicated, or if they are an adult up to 21 years of age and there is 
any detectable or noticeable amount of alcohol in their system while operating a motor vehicle in a public place as deemed by an 
officer. The breath or blood specimen determines if alcohol is present in their body and will identify the amount of alcohol in their 
system, as well as the presence of any other controlled substances or drugs.
A person who refuses to give a blood or breath specimen for analysis will have their driver license suspended for 180 days or up to 
730 days for subsequent offenses. If a person submits to a blood or breath specimen and the results show a BAC of 0.08 or greater, 
their driver license may be suspended for 90 days or up to 365 days for subsequent offenses. Anyone with a BAC of 0.08 or more is 
considered intoxicated.

Intoxication manslaughter Up to $10,000 2 to 20 years in TDCJ 180 days to 2 years
Know Your Legal Limit
The legal limit in Texas is 0.08 BAC or any amount which results in the loss of normal use of mental or physical faculties. The in -
formation provided in the Alcohol and Driving. Why Take the Risk?  table below is only a guide and is based on calculated averages. 
Alcohol tolerance may vary by individual. Food intake, medications, health, gender and psychological conditions are also influential 
factors, which affect the rate of alcohol absorption.
Drivers are encouraged to take drug and alcohol awareness courses to become better educated about the effects and consequences 
of drugs and alcohol. Insurance companies may provide liability insurance discounts to drivers who complete drug and alcohol 
awareness courses.

Chapter 11: Motor Vehicle Crashes Texas Driver HandbookChapter 11: Motor Vehicle Crashes
Most crashes in Texas result from speeding, failure to yield or stop appropriately, and driving under the influence of alcohol. If 
requested and available, exchange names, addresses, phone numbers, vehicle identification numbers, vehicle license plate numbers, 
driver license information, and insurance information with all drivers involved in the crash. Write the insurance company name and 
policy number exactly as it is shown on the driver’s proof-of-insurance card. If you have the name of the driver’s insurance company 
and the information is not listed directly on the insurance card, call the Texas Department of Insurance at (800) 252-3439 to get the 
company address and telephone number. Be sure to also note the location of the crash and write down the contact information if 
there are any witnesses.
You should always notify the appropriate law enforcement agency as soon as possible when:
•  There is an injury or fatality
•  The vehicles involved cannot be moved off the roadway
•  A driver leaves the scene of the crash
•  You suspect a driver is intoxicated.
If you are involved in a crash that is not investigated by a law enforcement officer and the crash has not resulted in injury or death of 
a person or damage to property of $1,000 or more, you must make a written report of the crash and file it with the Texas Department 
of Transportation (TxDOT) no later than the 10th day after the date of the crash. The written report must be on a TxDOT specified 
form. For a copy of this form, please visit the TxDOT website at www.txdot.gov .
Crash Resulting in Injury to, or Death of a person
If you are operating a motor vehicle involved in a crash resulting in injury to or death of a person, you must immediately stop your 
vehicle at the scene of the crash (or as close as possible to the scene of the crash) without obstructing traffic more than necessary. If 
you did not stop your vehicle at the scene, you must immediately return and remain at the scene of the crash until you have complied 
with the following:
1.  Provide your name and address, the registration number of the vehicle you were driving, and the name of your motor vehicle 
liability insurer to any person injured, or to the operator or occupant of, or person attending a vehicle involved in the collision
2.  Show your driver license (if requested and available) to any person injured, or to the operator or occupant of, or person attending 
a vehicle involved in the collision
3.  Provide any person injured in the crash reasonable assistance including, transporting or making arrangements for transport -
ing the person to a physician or hospital for medical treatment, if it is apparent treatment is necessary, or if the injured person 
requests the transportation.
Table 33: Penalties for Failure to Stop
Offense Penalty
1st offense crash resulting in a death of a person Second degree felony punishable by a fine not to exceed $10,000 and imprisonment in 
the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) for 2 to 20 years.
1st offense crash resulting in serious bodily injury Third degree felony punishable by a fine not to exceed $10,000 and imprisonment in 
the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) for 2 to 10 years.
1st offense crash resulting in injury Imprisonment in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) for up to 5 years or 
confinement in the county jail for up to 1 year; a fine not to exceed $5,000; or both a 
fine and imprisonment.
Crash Resulting in Damage to a Vehicle
If you are operating a motor vehicle involved in a crash resulting ONLY  in damage to a vehicle that is driven or attended by a person, 
you must immediately stop your vehicle at the scene of the crash or as close as possible to the scene of the crash without obstructing 
traffic more than necessary. If the crash occurs on a main lane, ramp, shoulder, median, or adjacent area and each vehicle involved 
can be normally and safely driven, drivers must move their vehicle as soon as possible to a designated crash investigation site, if 
available, a location on the frontage road, the nearest suitable cross street, or other suitable location. If you did not stop your vehicle 
at the scene, you must immediately return and remain at the scene of the crash until you have complied with the following:
1.  Provide your name and address, the registration number of the vehicle you were driving, and the name of your motor vehicle 
liability insurer to any person injured, or to the operator or occupant of, or person attending a vehicle involved in the collision
2.  Show your driver license (if requested and available) to any operator or occupant of, or person attending a vehicle involved in 
the collision

Hit-and-Run Crashes
If you are involved in a hit-and-run crash, report this crash to law enforcement for investigation. The Texas Department of Insurance 
advises uninsured motorist coverage will pay for damages in hit-and-run crashes reported to a law enforcement agency.
Aiding the Injured
In the event you are involved in a crash that injures another person, consider the information below:
1.  When calling a doctor or ambulance, ensure you take notice of your surroundings and state the location of the crash clearly and 
correctly.
2.  Do not assume people are not injured simply because they say they are not. Send for skilled help as quickly as possible. Un -
skilled handling can do more harm than good.
3.  Do not move or lift the victim(s) unless it is absolutely necessary. If a victim must be moved, get help and try not to change the 
position in which the victim was found.
4.  Stop serious bleeding with thick cloth pads, as clean as possible, apply with pressure by hand or by bandaging.
5.  Keep the victim(s) comfortable. If it is hot, cool the victim(s) and provide shade as much as possible. If it is cool, cover the victim 
with blankets or coats if necessary and if available.

Chapter 12: Pedestrian Safety Texas Driver HandbookChapter 12: Pedestrian Safety
A driver should always pay special attention to pedestrians (persons on foot). However, there are certain safety rules pedestrians 
should follow.
Laws and Safety Tips for Pedestrians
1.  Obey traffic control signals unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal.
2.  Do not cross the street between two intersections. It is dangerous to cross in the middle of a street.
3.  Use sidewalks when available, and do not walk in the street.
4.  Walk on the left side of the road if there are no sidewalks. Step off the pavement when a car approaches.
5.  If you cross a street at any point other than within a crosswalk at an intersection, you (the pedestrian) must yield 
the right-of-way to all vehicles.
6.  If you cross a street without using a pedestrian tunnel or overhead pedestrian crossing which has been provided, you (the pedes -
trian) must yield the right-of-way to all vehicles.
7.  When crossing at a crosswalk, keep right if possible.
8.  Blind, partially blind, or disabled individuals may carry a white cane while walking. Others must not display a white cane on 
any public street or highway.
9.  No person may stand in the road for the purpose of soliciting a ride, contributions, or business. A person may stand in a road to 
solicit a charitable contribution if authorized to do so by the local authority having jurisdiction over the road.
10.  Do not suddenly walk or run into the street in the path of a vehicle. These sudden actions may make it impossible for the vehicle 
operator to yield.
11.  Wait on the curb, not in the street, until the traffic signals change to green or read “Walk.”
12.  Always wear white or light colored clothing and/or carry a light or reflector when walking at night.
13.  Look both ways before crossing the street and before stepping out from behind parked cars.
14.  Be extra careful when getting off a streetcar or bus.
15.  Get in and out of cars on the curb side of the road when possible.
16.  Do not walk on a road when you are under the influence or consuming an alcoholic beverage. Alcohol is a contributing factor 
to pedestrian traffic crashes.
17.  Pedestrians should be aware that local authorities may have ordinances that require pedestrians to comply with the directions 
of an official traffic control device (signals, signs, etc.) and prohibit pedestrians from crossing a road in a business district or a 
designated highway, except in a crosswalk.
Laws and Safety Tips for Motorists
1.  If you see a pedestrian crossing or attempting to cross the street, slow down, use your horn if necessary, and be prepared to stop.
2.  Be alert to a pedestrian guided by an assistance animal or carrying a white cane. The white cane indicates the person may be 
blind, partially blind, or disabled. A driver shall take the necessary pre-cautions to avoid injuring or endangering a pedestrian 
crossing or attempting to cross the street. The driver shall bring the vehicle to a full stop if injury or danger can only be avoided 
by that action.
3.  Watch for individuals who are blind at bus stops, intersections, business areas, and near schools for the blind.

Chapter 13: Bicycle Laws and Safety Texas Driver HandbookChapter 13: Bicycle Laws and Safety
Bicycle Traffic Laws
A bicycle is a vehicle. Any person riding a bicycle has the same rights and responsibilities that apply to a driver operating a vehicle 
unless these cannot, by their nature, apply to a person operating a bicycle.
Any person who operates a bicycle is subject to the same penalties for violating a traffic law as a person operating a motor vehicle. 
All traffic convictions will be placed on the individual’s driver record, regardless if the conviction was for an offense committed on 
a bicycle or in a motor vehicle.
Do’s
1.  Always obey all traffic laws, signs, and signals. Stop at all stop signs and red lights.
2.  Always ride with the flow of traffic.
3.  Only ride on or astride a permanent and regular seat.
4.  When operating a bicycle on a one-way road with two or more marked traffic lanes, ride as near as possible to the left curb or 
edge of the road.
5.  Individuals riding two abreast on a “laned” road must ride in a single lane and not impede the flow of traffic.
6.  Bicyclists may ride on the shoulder of the road.
7.  Bicyclists must signal a turn or stop by:
a.  Using either their left arm pointing up or their right arm pointed horizontally to signal a right turn.
b.  Using their left arm pointed horizontally to signal a left turn.
c.  Using their left arm pointed downward to signal a stop. 
8.  A person operating a bicycle who is moving slower than the other traffic on the road shall ride as near as possible to the right 
curb or edge of the road unless:
a.  The person is overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction
b.  The person is preparing for a left turn at an intersection or onto a private road or driveway
c.  There are unsafe conditions in the road such as fixed or moving objects, parked or moving vehicles, pedestrians, animals, 
potholes, or debris, or
d.  The person is operating a bicycle in an outside lane that is:
- Less than 14 feet in width and doesn’t have a designated bicycle lane adjacent to that lane; or
- The lane is too narrow for a bicycle and a motor vehicle to safely travel side by side.
Don’ts
1.  Never carry more than the number of individuals it is designated or equipped for.
2.  Never ride opposite the flow of traffic.
3.  Never attach the bicycle or person to a moving streetcar or vehicle upon a road.
4.  Never carry any package, bundle, or article which prevents the rider from keeping at least one hand on the handlebars.
Shared Lane Marking
The shared lane marking may be used to:
1.  Assist bicyclists with lateral positioning in a shared lane with on-street parallel parking in order to 
reduce the chance of a bicyclist impacting the open door of a parked vehicle
2.  Assist bicyclists with lateral position in lanes too narrow for a motor vehicle and a bicycle to travel side 
by side within the same traffic lane
3.  Alert road users of the lateral location bicyclists are likely to occupy within the traveled way
4.  Encourage safe passing of bicyclists by motorists, or
5.  Reduce the incidence of wrong-way bicycling
62
Shared Lane Marking
Chapter 13: Bicycle Laws and Safety Texas Driver HandbookBicycles Must Be Properly Equipped
1.  Every bicycle must be equipped with a brake, which will enable the operator to make the wheels skid on dry, level, clean pave -
ment when applied.
2.  Hearing-impaired bicycle riders may display a safety flag.
3.  Every bicycle used at nighttime must be equipped with:
a.  A lamp on the front emits a white light visible from a distance of at least 500 feet in front of the bicycle, and
b.  A red, DPS-approved reflector on the rear visible from distances of 50 feet to 300 feet. (A red light on the rear visible from a 
distance of 500 feet may be used in addition to the red reflector.)
Bicycle Safety Guidelines
1. You may be required by law to wear a helmet depending on your local laws. 
2. When riding on pedestrian facilities, reduce speed and exercise caution.
3. Do not weave in and out of parked cars.
4. Move off the street to stop, park, or make repairs to your bicycle.
5. Select a route according to the rider’s bicycling skill and experience.
6. Bicycles may be equipped with a mirror.
7. Wear light colored or reflective clothing to make it easier for drivers to see you. 
Riding in Wet Weather
Water makes certain surfaces slick. Be aware of manhole covers and painted stripes on the road. Water also obscures some hazards. 
Watch for potholes filled with water. In addition, the visibility of motorists is greatly decreased in wet weather. 
63
Chapter 14: Additional Safety Tips Texas Driver HandbookChapter 14: Additional Safety Tips
Defensive Driving
To avoid crashes, the defensive driver should:
1.  Stay alert and keep eyes moving to keep track of what is happening at all times
2.  Look for trouble spots developing all around
3.  Have a plan of action
4.  Know that the law requires drivers to protect each other from their own mistakes
Safety Belts
The driver and all passengers, regardless of age, in a passenger vehicle are required to use safety belts if occupying a seat in a vehicle 
equipped with a safety belt. Any child under 8 years old must be secured in a federally approved child car seat if occupying a seat 
in a vehicle equipped with a safety belt, unless the child is more than 4’9” tall.
Safety belt requirements include pickups, SUVs, and trucks. Safety belts help keep you:
1.  From being thrown from your car. Your chances of being killed are five times greater if you are thrown 
from your car
2.  From hitting the dashboard too hard
3.  In better control of your car
Whatever your reason for not wearing safety belts, it is dangerous and violates state law.
Penalties for Driving Without a Safety Belt
A driver can receive a citation for not wearing his/her safety belt and for not having each child under the age of 17 in a safety seat 
or safety belt. Anyone who is at least 15 years of age can receive a citation for not wearing a safety belt. There are no exemptions 
to the safety belt laws. However, there are some defenses to prosecution for postal workers, individuals who deliver the newspaper, 
utility workers, solid waste truck workers, certain commercial farm vehicle operators, or medical reasons with a physician’s note.

c.  In a hayride permitted by the governing body of or a law enforcement agency of each county or municipality in which the 
hayride will occur
When Stopped by Law Enforcement
If you are stopped by law enforcement, it is suggested you:
1.  Slow down and move the vehicle safely to the right of the road.
2.  Park your vehicle as far to the right of the main traffic lane as possible. If available, park on the right shoulder or, if unavailable, 
park on a nearby well-lighted side street or parking lot away from high volume traffic.
3.  Place the vehicle in a parking position, set the emergency brake, turn the engine off, and activate the hazard warning lights.
4.  If at night, turn on the interior dome light. 
5.  Remain in the car, lower the driver’s window if you feel safe to do so. Keep both hands clearly in sight on top of the steering 
wheel. Wait for the law enforcement officer to give you instructions. An officer may approach from either side of the vehicle. 
6.  Tell the officer if you are transporting any type of weapon. 
7.  Before reaching into your glove box or under the seat to retrieve your proof of insurance or driver’s license, inform the officer 
of where the items are located and follow the officer’s directions. 
8.  If asked to exit the vehicle, check for passing vehicles to exit safely. 
9. Advise passengers to remain in the car unless other instructions are given by the law enforcement officer, and 
10.  At the conclusion of the traffic stop, give the appropriate signals and safely return to the proper lane of traffic when released 
by the law enforcement officer. 
Obligations, Responsibilities, Courtesy and Safety
State law requires a driver to immediately stop when approached by an authorized emergency vehicle and you may be arrested 
if you do not stop immediately. If you feel the area is unsafe to stop immediately or if you have concerns the vehicle is not a real 
police vehicle, you can take the following steps to minimize the risk of being arrested or charges being filed against you: turn on 
your hazard lights and drive slowly and carefully below the posted speed limit; you may call 9-1-1 and remain on the phone with 
the operator while you stop and verify the officer’s identity; you may drive to a nearby well-lighted, populated place to stop. It is 
important to understand that law enforcement jurisdictions overlap and a local 9-1-1 call center operator may not be able to imme -
diately determine what officer is working in that area at that time.  If you stop in an unsafe location, such as on a bridge or a high 
traffic roadway, an officer may direct you over the public address speaker to move to a safer location. Follow the officer’s directions. 
Law enforcement officers, drivers, and passengers should respond with courtesy during traffic stops and other officer/citizen inter -
actions. Drivers and passengers should not exit the vehicle unless asked to do so. Exiting your vehicle may be perceived as aggres -
sive behavior and a threat to the officer’s safety. Drivers and passengers inside a vehicle should not attempt to reach, dig, or search 
for their license or insurance documents before or while an officer is approaching. Drivers who transport handguns in their vehicles 
are encouraged to keep them in a separate location from license and insurance documentation.
65
Chapter 14: Additional Safety Tips Texas Driver Handbook During a traffic stop, the driver and any passengers are subjected to an investigative detention, which may only last for a 
reasonable amount of time. Passengers can ask the officer if they are free to leave and do so if the officer agrees. Law enforcement 
may ask questions during this time. You cannot be punished for refusing to answer questions; however, drivers are required by law to 
display a driver license when requested by an officer. If you are lawfully arrested, you are also required to give your name, residence 
address, and date of birth. A driver or a passenger who gives law enforcement a false or fraudulent identity or false answers may be 
arrested.  It may be to your benefit to speak to law enforcement, such as to convey the reason you may have an emergency or for the 
driver to provide the officer your name, address and date of birth if you do not have your driver license with you. 
Law enforcement may also ask for consent to search your vehicle or person. You may grant or deny the request to search; however, if 
an officer has probable cause to believe that your vehicle contains evidence of a crime, it can be searched without your consent. If an 
officer reasonably believes that you have a weapon, the officer can conduct a pat down search of your person and the immediate area 
around you, including areas of your vehicle. It is unlawful to physically resist a search, but you have the right to notify the officer 
that you do not consent to any search. 
Complaints or Concerns
If you believe an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter, you should report that conduct to the of -
ficer’s superiors and follow agency guidelines for submitting complaints against officers as soon as possible. Officers will normally 
provide their names and badge numbers on request, when practical. Due to the overlapping of jurisdictions, drivers should make sure 
they identify the correct agency as well as any identifying aspects of the officer and law enforcement vehicle.
Drivers should refrain from arguing the validity of a charge during the traffic stop or detention. Signing a citation is not admitting 
guilt. It simply confirms your promise to pay the fine or contact the court. If you do not agree with the charge brought against you 
and wish to contest it, you should argue your case before a judge or request a jury trial and acquire the services of an attorney to 
represent you.
False Identification Offense
A person commits an offense if he/she gives a false or fictitious name to a law enforcement officer who has lawfully arrested or 
detained the person. 
Evading arrest or detention
A person commits an offense if he intentionally flees from a person he knows is a peace officer or federal special investigator at -
tempting to lawfully arrest or detain him/her. You will be subject to higher penalties if you use a vehicle or watercraft while evading 
arrest or cause injury to another person.
Road Rage
Each year, road rage, also referred to as aggressive driving, causes hundreds of injuries and deaths. Aggressive driving occurs when 
a driver becomes angry or irritated and as a result, fails to follow the rules of the road. An aggressive driver will intentionally ag -
gravate or attempt to aggravate other drivers and in some cases cause bodily injury, property damage, or death to others.
Tips to Avoid Road Rage
1.  Plan your trip or schedule in advance. Allow extra time in case your vehicle breaks down or you encounter traffic congestion 
due to a crash, road construction, or rush-hour traffic.
2.  When caught in traffic, do not get angry. Try to relax and listen to music you enjoy. Remember, traffic congestion is usually 
temporary and you will soon be on your way.
3.  Should you need to use the horn, tap the horn; do not hold down the horn. Do not confront other drivers or make obscene 
gestures.
4.  Do not cut into another driver’s lane of traffic. Properly signal your intentions to change lanes and change lanes when it is safe 
to do so. Turn your turn signal off after you complete your lane change.
5.  Do not intentionally slow down, slam on your brakes, or speed up to keep someone from passing or entering your lane of travel.
6.  Do not tailgate; follow at a safe distance.
7.  Always remember to drive friendly and report aggressive driving to the local authorities.

Chapter 14: Additional Safety Tips Texas Driver HandbookTransporting Cargo and Materials
To prevent cargo or loose materials from falling or spilling from a car, truck, trailer, etc. onto the road and causing a crash or damage 
to the roads, drivers must comply with certain state requirements.
A vehicle must be equipped and maintained to prevent loose material from escaping by blowing or spilling and a vehicle bed must:
1. Not have a hole, crack, or other opening through which loose material can escape
2. Be enclosed by side panels and on the front by a panel or the vehicle cab
3. Be enclosed by a securely closed tailgate or panel on the rear to prevent spillage
4.  Cover the load securely at the front and back of the load, unless completely enclosed in a compartment or the load does not blow 
or spill over the load carrying compartment. 
No person shall load or transport any loose material on or over the public highways, such as dirt, sand, gravel, wood chips, or other 
material (except agricultural products in their natural state), capable of blowing or spilling from a vehicle unless:
1.  The bed carrying the load is completely enclosed on both sides and on the front and rear by a tailgate, board or panel; and all 
must be so constructed as to prevent the escape of any part of the load by blowing or spilling; and
2.  The top of the load is covered with a canvas, tarpaulin, or other covering firmly secured to the front and back to prevent the 
escape of the load because of blowing or spilling. This requirement does not apply to:
a.  Any load-carrying compartment that completely encloses the load; or
b.  The transporting of any load of loose materials not blowing or spilling over the top of the load-carrying compartment.
Safety Chains
Safety chains are required when certain types of vehicles are towing trailers in order to prevent the trailer from breaking loose and 
causing a serious crash. A person may not drive a passenger car or light truck while towing a trailer, semi-trailer, or house trailer 
on a public highway in Texas unless safety chains are attached from a trailer, semi-trailer, or house trailer to the towing vehicle. 
The types of safety chains and the manner of attachment must be approved by DPS. The requirements of this law do not apply to a 
passenger car or light truck towing a trailer or semi-trailer used for agricultural purposes or to any trailer or semi-trailer or house 
trailer operated in compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.
Towing
When one vehicle is towing another, the drawbar, chain, rope, cable, or other connection must:
1. Not be longer than 15 feet from one vehicle to another
2. Be strong enough to pull all weight drawn
3. Attach a white flag not less than 12 inches square
4.  Not tow more than three vehicles attached to it by mounting the front wheels of trailing vehicles on the bed of another vehicle 
and leaving only the rear wheels in contact with the roadway
This limit does not apply to trailers transporting poles, pipes, machinery, or other structures that cannot be easily dismembered. 
Carbon Monoxide
Beware of carbon monoxide poisoning. Cars produce carbon monoxide, which is a deadly gas. Make sure you are getting plenty of 
fresh air.
Don’t:
1.  Leave the motor running in a garage
2.  Leave vents open when following closely behind another car
3.  Leave the motor running and the windows closed while the car is parked
4.  Drive with a defective muffler or exhaust system
5.  Use the heater or air conditioner in a parked car with the windows closed in an enclosed space
If you encounter a carbon monoxide poisoning victim, move them to fresh air and call 911.
As a driver, you should know all the safety and operational features of the vehicle you are driving. Make sure you and your 
passengers are traveling in a vehicle that is safe and in good working order. Drive safely and obey all criminal and traffic laws.

Chapter 14: Additional Safety Tips Texas Driver HandbookDriving with Disability Program
Communication Impediment with a Peace Officer is an optional restriction code offered on Texas State ID and Driver License for 
those wanting to alert law enforcement of a challenge with communication. Physician signed form required.
If you want to place the code for “Communication Impediment with a Peace Officer” on your Texas ID or driver license, ask your 
doctor to complete form DL-101  https://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/DL-101.pdf  and present it at the driver license 
office. The code will go on the back of your license, similar to other codes like organ donor or corrective lenses. 
The option for disclosure of a communication disability/impediment when registering a vehicle through the Texas Department of 
Motor Vehicles is also available, the communication impediment will then be privately placed in the Texas Law Enforcement 
Telecommunication System (TLETS) thus alerting the officer of the challenge PRIOR to approaching the vehicle in a pull-over 
scenario.  Form VTR-216  https://www.txdmv.gov/sites/default/files/form_files/VTR-216.pdf  must be completed by a licensed 
physician if the applicant has a physical health condition or a licensed physician, licensed psychologist, or a non-physician mental 
health professional if the applicant has a mental health condition. Present this form when you register your vehicle with Texas DMV.

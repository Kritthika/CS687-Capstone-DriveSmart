The Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  iINTRODUCTION
The Official Florida Driver License Handbook is produced by the Florida Department of 
Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV). This guide has the information needed to prepare for the Florida Driver License Class E Knowledge Exam, the Driving Skills Test, and to help you drive safely and lawfully.
Disclaimer
The Official Florida Driver License Handbook contains condensed and paraphrased 
points of Florida laws and provides safety advice not specifically addressed in the laws. The handbook is not a legal authority and is not intended for use in court. This handbook will not reflect any changes made by the Florida Legislature after the last revision date (located at the bottom of this page).
Warning
Florida law prohibits using a false name, making a false statement, concealing a material fact or otherwise using fraud in an application for a driver license or ID card. The penalty can be up to five years in prison, a $5,000 fine, and suspension of any existing driving privilege for at least one year. 
In addition, it is illegal to permit or authorize an unlicensed person to drive a motor 
vehicle and doing so can result in a 60-day jail sentence and a $500 fine. If the vehicle is involved in a crash resulting in bodily injury or death of any person, the person who permitted the unlicensed person to drive may (unless it is an automatic manda -
tory suspension) have their license suspended for one year.
Public Records
Florida law requires FLHSMV to collect certain personal information during the licensing process. This information, which identifies licensed individuals, is used for records management, driver improvement, financial responsibility, and law enforce -
ment purposes. If you do not provide the required information, you will not receive a driver license or ID card. 
Florida’s Public Records Law makes all records made or received by FLHSMV in the 
course of its official business available for inspection, unless specifically exempted by law. Personal information, including name, address, and driver license number is exempt from public disclosure, but may be given to law enforcement agencies and other entities permitted by law to access the information. Medical information, social security number, and emergency contact information are available only as specifically authorized by law.
FLHSMV strives to ensure the accuracy of the information obtained during the licens-
ing process. If you discover any incorrect information, please call (850) 617-2000 or mail your request with your complete name, date of birth, driver license number, information about the error, and any documentation to support your request to: Chief of the Bureau of Records, 2900 Apalachee Parkway MS 89, Tallahassee, FL 32399. Some information, such as reports of convictions received from a court, can only be corrected if notification from the court is received that the report was in error.

11. STUDY GUIDE FOR KNOWLEDGE EXAM 91
vi ©2023 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor VehiclesLETTER FROM THE DIRECTOR
Welcome Florida Motorist,
The Florida Department of Highway Safety and 
Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) provides the Official Florida Driver License Handbook to educate and encourage you to safely learn the rules of the road and become a confident and responsible driver.
When you are behind the wheel, you should be 
knowledgeable of traffic laws and how to safely operate your vehicle without distraction or impair-ment. Florida's population includes residents and tourists who travel on state roadways; you must always exercise caution and pay attention to your actions, those of other drivers, and the roadway itself. Every day in Florida over 1,000 crashes occur, many of which are preventable. You are responsible for taking driving seriously, understanding that your choices before and while behind the wheel affect everyone on the roadway.
Impaired, drowsy, speeding, aggressive, and distracted driving are behaviors that 
most significantly contribute to crashes resulting in fatalities or serious injuries. Before you decide to drive, you should be free of alcohol, drug, or prescription pill impairment, calm and focused. Responsible driving keeps everyone safe.
Once licensed, you have the freedom to explore all that Florida has to offer. Our 
roadways will take you from the beaches in the South to the canopied roads of North Florida. Please remember while enjoying the state to take your safety and that of others seriously by obeying traffic laws and committing to only operate your vehicle free of distraction, impairment or reckless behavior.
Dave Kerner  
Executive Director  
Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles

If you have never held—or do not have in your possession—a driver license in any 
state, country, or jurisdiction, you must complete a TLSAE course before applying for a driver license in the state of Florida. Driver education courses offered by some county school boards may substitute for this requirement. Please contact your local school board for further information. 
If you are under 21 years old and receive a notice of suspension for driving with a 
Blood Alcohol Level (BAL) of .02 to .05, you must complete a TLSAE course in order to reinstate your driver license on a hardship basis.
Basic Driver Improvement (BDI) Course

greater than $500.
 ◆You were convicted of:

 ◆passing a school bus when it displayed a stopped signal.
 ◆racing on the highway.
 ◆reckless driving.
If you receive a ticket for a non-criminal moving violation, the violation was not in a 
CMV and you do not hold a CDL, you may elect to attend a basic driver improvement course in lieu of points on your driving record. (You may not elect to attend if you were charged with exceeding the speed limit by more than 30 MPH.) An individual who elects to attend a basic driver improvement course for a non-criminal traffic citation will receive an 18 percent reduction toward the civil penalty.
In some cases, you may choose to attend a course to receive insurance discounts. 
This discount is solely at the discretion of your insurance company.

 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
If, as a result of a moving violation, you 
elect to attend and complete a basic driver improvement course, you will receive the following benefits:
1. Insurance companies cannot 
impose an additional premium or refuse to renew a policy for motor vehicle insurance solely because the insured committed a non-criminal traffic infraction, with the following exceptions: a second infraction within 18 months; a third infraction within 36 months; or exceeding the speed limit by more than 15 MPH.
2. Points may not be added to your driver license record if adjudica -
tion of guilt is withheld. You may not make an election under this subsection if you have made this election in the preceding 12 months. A person may make no more than five elections in a lifetime.

received the traffic citation and prior to attending class, you must:
1. Inform the Clerk of Court in the 
county where you received the citation that you want to go to traffic school, and
2. Pay an election fee to the Clerk of Court in the county where you received the citation.

your traffic citation is on the back of the citation. You are required to choose one of the three options within 30 days of receiving the citation.Advanced Driver Improvement 
(ADI) Courses

ful blood or breath alcohol level; refusal to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test; or conviction of driving under the influence or possession of a controlled substance.

ination is to determine that you:
1. Can understand road signs, traffic 
signals, and markings.

 T he Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  23  YOUR DRIVING PRIVILEGE
Driving in Florida is a privilege you earn. In addition to the rules of the road, you 
must also abide by the following laws in order to maintain your driving privilege.
Insurance Laws
Florida law requires drivers and vehicle owners to maintain insurance to cover costs in case of a crash. These laws include the No-Fault Law and Financial Responsibility Law.
No-Fault Law
Before you register your car in Florida, you must show proof of Personal Injury Protection (PIP)  and Property Damage Liability (PDL) coverage. PIP covers your 
injuries if you’re in a crash, no matter who caused it. PDL coverage pays for damage 
to other people’s property that you caused.
Every owner or person in charge of operating a motor vehicle on Florida roadways must:
 ◆provide proof of valid PIP and PDL insurance at the time of vehicle registration;
 ◆have a minimum of $10,000 in PIP AND a minimum of $10,000 in PDL coverage;
 ◆purchase the policy from an insurance agency licensed to do business in 
Florida;
 ◆maintain the insurance continuously throughout the registration period; and
 ◆always have proof of valid Florida insurance readily available when the vehicle is being driven on Florida roadways.
You must comply if you own a motor vehicle that has been in the state for 90 days  
(consecutive or non-consecutive) during the last 365 days. You must maintain proper 
insurance or your driver license/license plate registration can be suspended.
Your insurance company is required by law to notify FLHSMV when you renew your 
policy, if you fail to renew it when due, if the vehicle is removed from the policy that has a valid registration, or if the policy is canceled either by you or the insurance com -
pany. If you don’t renew your coverage, it is canceled or if a vehicle is removed from a policy, FLHSMV will send you a notice that you must provide proof of new coverage. If you fail to provide proof of new insurance, your driver license and license plate can be suspended for up to three years.
If you don’t maintain insurance coverage throughout the vehicle registration period, 
you must turn in the vehicle license plate to any driver license service center. Turn in your plate before canceling your insurance to prevent the suspension of your license 
and to avoid reinstatement fees.
Always carry proof of insurance when you or someone else is driving your vehicle. Your 
insurance company will provide you with a Florida Insurance ID Card. You must have 
the card (or electronic proof on a smart phone) with you when you’re driving. You may receive a citation if you are stopped by a law enforcement officer and don’t have proof of insurance with you. You’ll have to go to court to prove that you had insurance

 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
coverage at the time you were stopped, 
or your driver license may be suspended. If you don’t have proof and the judge convicts you, your driver license and license plate will be suspended. In order to lift the suspension, you will have to get insurance and pay a reinstatement fee ($150 to $500).
If your driver license and license plate 
have been under suspension for 30 days or more, a law enforcement officer can seize your license plate immediately. The officer may also take you to jail for driv -
ing with a suspended license, which is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
If your driver license or license plate is 
suspended for not having insurance, you won’t be able to get a temporary license for any reason, not even to go to work. If you show a law enforcement officer an insurance card when you know the insurance has been canceled—or if you falsify the card—you may be arrested and charged with a second-degree misdemeanor.
FLHSMV will provide you with an opportu -
nity to prove insurance coverage or have 
an administrative hearing. When you receive the notice of suspension of your license you may request a hearing; other -
wise, one will not be scheduled for you. 
Financial Responsibility Law
In addition to the required PIP and PDL coverage, if you’re in a crash, you will have to prove that you are financially responsible for all damages you caused. You can prove such financial responsibil -
ity by having insurance in effect from a company licensed to do business in Florida, or obtaining a Financial Responsibility Certificate from FLHSMV. Get more information about Financial Responsibility Certificates at flhsmv.gov .
Depending on your driving record, you may have to obtain additional insurance beyond the basic PIP and PDL require -
ments. For example, Florida law requires you to have Bodily Injury Liability (BIL) insurance—and increased PDL cover -
age—when you are convicted of Driving Under the Influence (DUI). The coverage required in such a case must be at least $100,000 BIL for injuries to one person, $300,000 BIL for injuries to two or more people, and $50,000 PDL. This higher coverage must be in effect for three years after your DUI conviction. The higher limits will no longer apply if you are not convicted of another DUI or any felony traffic offense during that three-year period.
Other higher coverage limits are required 
by law if: your driver license is suspended for accumulation of excessive points for infractions; you cause a crash and people were injured; your driver license was revoked for Habitual Traffic Offender status; or your driver license was revoked for any serious offense. The required coverage for these cases are $10,000 BIL for injuries to one person, $20,000 BIL for injuries to two or more people, $10,000 PDL; OR $30,000 combined single limits.
If you do not provide proof of higher 
coverage limits, your driver license and/ or license plates will be suspended for up to three years.
In addition, if you are the driver or the 
owner of a vehicle involved in a crash that is your fault, FLHSMV can require you to pay for the damages before your driving privilege is reinstated.

Road Damage
It is against the law to damage the roads by driving on the rim of a flat tire or by any other means.
Safety Belts and Child 
Passenger Safety
SAFETY BELTS
Safety belts save lives, but only if worn 
correctly every time you are in a motor vehicle! You are far more likely to be killed in a crash if you are not wearing a safety belt. In a crash, your safety belt keeps you:
 ◆from being ejected from the vehicle;
 ◆from being thrown against other 
passengers, your steering wheel, or windshield; and
 ◆behind the wheel, where you can control the vehicle.
Wear both the lap belt and the shoulder 
belt. Wear your lap belt around your hips and wear your shoulder belt across your chest. Your safety belt will not work if it is tucked behind you. Airbags are not a substitute for safety belts!
CHILD PASSENGER SAFETY SEATS/
RESTRAINTS
The best child seat is one that fits your 
child, fits your car, and that you can use correctly every time. Read the car seat’s instruction manual and the portion of your vehicle’s owner manual on car seat installation. Children under 13 should be 
28  ©2023 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
secured in the rear seat because airbags 
can injure or kill young children in the front seat. Never place a rear-facing car seat in front of an airbag.
It is the parent or guardian’s responsibil -
ity to supply a proper child restraint 
when transporting a child in a vehicle for hire (e.g., taxi, bus, limousine).
FLORIDA LAW REQUIRES:
 ◆All drivers, front seat passengers, 
and passengers under the age of 18 wear safety belts*.
 ◆Children under age 4 must be in a safety seat and children ages 4 and 5 must be in either a safety seat or a booster seat. 
Drivers will be charged with a safety belt/
child restraint violation if any passenger under 18 is not properly restrained. Passengers 18 years old or older will be charged with the violation if they fail to wear a safety belt when required by law.
In Need of Car Seat Assistance?  
Whether you've just installed a car 
seat, or need help installing or using one, get help at a car seat fitting station near you. Certified techni -
cians will check your car seat (free of charge in most cases) and will show you how to correctly install it.
Find a Florida Fitting Station:  
www.floridaoprc.ce.ufl.edu/oprc/
Fitting_Stations.asp
Passengers on a school bus equipped 
with safety belts or restraint systems shall wear a properly adjusted and fas -
tened safety belt or restraint at all times while the school bus is in operation.EXEMPTIONS
Florida law exempts the following from 
the safety belt requirements:
 ◆A person certified by a physician  
as having a medical condition that 
causes safety belt use to be inappropriate or dangerous. (Keep a copy of certification while driving or riding in a motor vehicle.)
 ◆Employee of a newspaper home delivery service while delivering newspapers.
 ◆School buses purchased new prior to December 31, 2000.
 ◆Buses used for transportation of persons for compensation.
 ◆Farm equipment.
 ◆Trucks of a net weight of more than 26,000 pounds.
 ◆A safety belt (without booster seat) may only be used for children 4–5 years of age when the driver is not a member of the child’s immediate family and the child is being transported as a favor or in an emergency.
*Some exemptions apply to cars manufactured 
prior to 1968 and trucks prior to 1972.
Speeding
Speeding endangers everyone on the 
road. Obeying speed limits and not driving aggressively improves safety by reducing the probability and severity of crashes. All motorists must obey speed limits and are responsible for knowing the speed limit on the roadway. In Florida, the speed limit will never be higher than 70 mph.
Speeding citations can result in fines 
and points on your driving record.
 T he Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  29   .............................................................................................Your Driving Privi Le ge
 ◆The fine for exceeding the speed 
limit by more than 50 MPH is $1,000 for the first offense and $2,500 for 
the second.
 ◆Fines are doubled when speeding 
infractions occur within a school zone or construction zone, with possible civil penalties up to $1,000, and you can be required to complete a driving course.
Traffic Crashes
If you are charged in a crash, you may 
have to go to court. The law enforcement officer who comes to the scene of the 
crash will file charges against any driver 
who violated a traffic law. Those charged will have a chance to be heard in court. The court will then decide the penalty. Others who were present at the crash 
may have to come to court as a witness.
If you are found at fault in a crash where 
anyone was injured and transported to a 
medical treatment facility, or it is your second collision in a two-year period, you will be required by law to attend a 
Traffic Collision Avoidance Course.
THREE CRASHES IN THREE YEARS LAW
If you were convicted of, or pleaded nolo 
contendre (no contest) to your third 
traffic offense that caused a crash within 
36 months, you must complete a FLHSMV-  
approved driver improvement course that includes behind-the-wheel training and an assessment of your driving safety.
You must:
 ◆complete a 12 hour Advanced 
Driver Improvement (ADI) course;
 ◆receive 4 hours of behind-the- 
wheel training from a Florida licensed commercial driving school 
(CDS); and ◆pass the extended driving test with 
a driver license examiner.
Failure to complete requirements within 90 days will result in license cancellation.
Point System
There are infractions that can cause the loss or restriction of your driving privi -
leges. You receive points for moving 
violations. If you accumulate too many 
points in a certain period of time, your license will be suspended and can be revoked.
 ◆12 points within a 12-month 
period—30 day suspension
 ◆18 points within a 18-month period—3 month suspension
 ◆24 points within a 36-month period—1 year suspension
The motorist receives the same number 
of points listed if the conviction occurs out-of-state or in a federal court. 
Mandatory Restriction  
for Minors
Any driver under the age of 18 who accu -
mulates 6 or more points within a 12 month period is automatically restricted 
for one year to driving for Business 
Purposes Only. 
If additional points are accumulated,  
the restriction is extended for 90 days 
for every additional point received.

Administrative Hearings
If your driving privilege is suspended or 
revoked, you may be eligible to apply for a hardship license or reinstatement. For eligibility information, contact the local Bureau of Administrative Reviews (BAR) office, driver license service center, or the FLHSMV Customer Service Center. To schedule an administrative hearing go to MyDMVPortal.flhsmv.gov .
If you are administratively suspended for a breath or blood alcohol level of .08 or above, or refuse to submit to a breath, urine, or blood test and wish to appeal this suspension, you must apply for a formal or informal review hearing at the appropriate BAR office within 10 days of your date of arrest.
A first time DUI offender who has never 
had prior DUI related offenses, may be eligible to request a review of eligibility for a restricted driver license. By accept -

 The Off icial Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  33  BEFORE YOU DRIVE—YOU THE DRIVER
Driving an automobile is a huge responsibility. In order to drive safely, you must be  
fully engaged: hands on the wheel, eyes on the road, and mind on driving. Anything  
that affects your physical or mental condition can impair your ability to drive.
Physical Health
It's important to get regular vision, hearing, and general physical check-ups. Get 
treatment for illnesses and avoid driving when sick. Remember that whenever you are prescribed medication, you should ask your doctor or pharmacist how it can affect your driving.
Considerations for Older Drivers
As we age, physical changes require us to adapt so that we can continue to drive safely. Older drivers should:
 ◆Get regular medical and eye exams to identify physical and mental conditions 
that may affect driving;
 ◆Ask the doctor or pharmacist how medications—especially when taken in combination with other medications—affect driving;
 ◆Consult with a doctor about an exercise program to maintain the flexibility and strength needed for safe driving;
 ◆Make vehicle adjustments as necessary. 
 ◆If it's difficult to turn the steering wheel, consider getting a steering knob. 
 ◆If you have difficulty turning your head to check blind spots, consider getting a larger side mirror;
 ◆If it's difficult to buckle up; consider an assistive device to help reach the belt. 
 ◆Avoid wearing sunglasses in dim or dark conditions; and
 ◆Avoid risky driving times:
 ◆Dusk, dawn, and nighttime.
 ◆Bad weather.
 ◆Rush-hour traffic.
 ◆Fast-paced highways.
The Florida Safe Mobility for Life program provides information 
and resources to raise awareness and to improve the safety, access, and mobility needs of Florida’s aging road users. Resources available provide education for older adults, families, caregivers, and community partners on how to achieve safe mobility for life. To learn more, please visit safemobilityfl.com .

Distracted Driving
Distracted driving is extremely risky behavior that puts you and your passengers in 
danger, as well as pedestrians and bicyclists sharing the road. Focused attention on driving helps to prevent crashes.
There are three main categories of driver distraction:
Categories of Distraction
1. Visual —taking your eyes off the road
2. Manual —taking your hands off the steering wheel
3. Cognitive —thinking about anything other than driving
Texting involves all three categories of distractions, making it one of the most dan -
gerous of distracted driving behaviors.* However, this is not the only cause of 
distracted driving. Other common distractions include:
 ◆talking on a cell phone;
 ◆watching an object, person, or event 
outside of the vehicle;
 ◆reaching for an object;
 ◆interacting with passengers;
 ◆eating or drinking; ◆unsecured pets;
 ◆grooming;
 ◆adjusting radio or climate controls;
 ◆lighting a cigarette; and/or
 ◆daydreaming.
* It is illegal in Florida to operate a motor vehicle while texting. Florida law prohibits a person from operating 
a motor vehicle while using a wireless communications device in a handheld manner in a designated school 
crossing, school zone, or work zone.

 The Off icial Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  35   .........................................................................Before You Drive—You The Driver
Drinking & Driving
Alcohol reduces all of the skills necessary 
to drive safely, such as judgment, reac -
tion, vision, and concentration. Alcohol is absorbed into the lining of the stomach and then passes directly into the blood -
stream and reaches your brain within minutes after consumption. A person’s judgment is the first thing affected after drinking an alcoholic beverage.
Even one drink of alcohol can affect your 
driving. Alcohol slows your reflexes and reaction time, reduces your ability to see clearly, and makes you less alert. You will have trouble judging distance, speed, and movement of other vehicles. You will also have trouble controlling your vehicle.
If you drink alcohol—even just one 
drink—your chances of being in a crash are much greater than if you did not drink any alcohol. No one can drink alcohol and drive safely, even if you have been driving for many years.
Because drinking alcohol and driving is 
so dangerous, the penalties are very tough. People who drive after drinking risk heavy fines, higher insurance rates, loss of driver license, and even jail sen -
tences. A DUI (Driving Under the Influence) conviction must remain on your driving record for 75 years.
Do Not Drink and Drive!
 ◆Before drinking, designate a sober 
driver.
 ◆If you are the designated driver, do not drink. One drink is one too many.
 ◆If you are impaired—and did not designate a driver—use a rideshare service, call a sober friend or family member, or use public transporta -
tion to get home safely.Remember, friends don’t let 
friends drive drunk.  If you know 
someone who is about to drive impaired, take their keys and help them get a safe ride home.
Drowsy Driving
Drowsy driving can be just as dangerous 
as drunk driving. Do not drive when you are tired. It is risky to drive drowsy because fatigue (being sleepy) can:
 ◆slow your thought processes and 
reaction time;
 ◆affect your judgment and vision;
 ◆impair your senses and abilities; and/or
 ◆cause micro-sleeping (“nodding off”) or falling completely asleep.
The two main causes of drowsy driving 
are lack of quality/quantity of sleep and driving at times of the day when you would normally be sleeping. Avoid driv -
ing drowsy!
 ◆Don’t drive at times when you 
would normally be asleep.
 ◆Get a good night’s sleep before you travel.
 ◆On long trips, take a break every 100 miles or 2 hours.
 ◆If you feel sleepy find a safe place to stop and take a nap.
 ◆Use the “buddy system” and switch drivers when needed.

 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Drugged Driving
Driving while impaired by drugs is illegal 
and subject to the same penalties as driving while impaired by alcohol. Besides alcohol, there are many drugs that can affect a person’s ability to safely operate a vehicle. This is true for many prescription drugs, as well as over-the-counter medications for allergies and colds. If a person is taking medication, they should be sure to check the label for warnings about the medication’s effects prior to driving. If they are not sure it is safe to take the drug and drive, they should ask their doctor or pharma -
cist about any side effects.
Alcohol and drugs should not be con -
sumed at the same time. Mixing alcohol 
and drugs often multiplies the effects of the alcohol and drugs. For example, one drink, when you are also taking an allergy or cold medication, could have the same effect as several drinks.
Illegal drugs and controlled substances, 
such as marijuana, also affect a person’s reflexes, judgment and alertness along with their many other dangerous side effects. These drugs can give a person a false sense of alertness and self-confi -
dence or make a person drowsy and unable to react to simple situations.
Emotions
Emotions can have an effect on driving safely. You may not be able to drive safely if you are worried, excited, crying, angry, or depressed. Emotions can distract you from your driving because your mind is focused on other issues, not driving. Your emotional state can alter the way you react—or overreact—to driving situations. Take time to calm down and get focused before driving.Road Rage
Road rage is violent or visibly angry behavior by a driver which can result in crashes or other incidents on roadways. Signs include:
 ◆sudden acceleration or braking,
 ◆following too closely;
 ◆cutting off other drivers;
 ◆preventing other vehicles from 
merging into your lane;
 ◆excessively hitting the horn or flashing headlights;
 ◆shouting obscenities or threats;
 ◆making obscene hand gestures;
 ◆intentionally causing a crash;
 ◆getting out of a vehicle in an attempt to start a confrontation;
 ◆using a weapon or threatening to use a weapon; and/or
 ◆throwing objects from the vehicle.
If another driver is threatening you or 
intentionally driving dangerously around you, remain calm and try to put as 
much distance between you and them as possible . Slow down and let them 
pass. Do not make eye contact; do not make obscene gestures. If you need help, call *FHP (*347) or 911.
 The Off icial Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  37  BEFORE YOU DRIVE—YOUR VEHICLE
Vehicle Registration
The vehicle you own must have a Florida 
registration certificate and license plate.  
Non-residents who accept employment or engages in a trade, profession or occupation in Florida; or enrolls children to be educated in a Florida public school, must obtain the registration certificate and license plate within 10 days after beginning employment or enrollment. You also must have a Florida Certificate of Title for your vehicle unless an out-of-state lien holder/lessor holds the title and will not release it to Florida.
To get a registration certificate and 
license plate, you must show proof of Florida insurance (in most cases, you need a Florida driver license to get insurance.) You must also prove that you own your vehicle by showing your certifi -
cate of title. 
The vehicle identification number (VIN) 
on any vehicle previously titled or regis -
tered in another state must be verified by one of several designated officials before the vehicle can be titled and registered in Florida. VIN verification is not required on any new vehicles (regard -
less of whether purchased in Florida or out-of-state), or new/used mobile homes, trailer type recreational vehicles (travel trailers, camp trailers, truck campers, and fifth wheel recreational trailers), or trailers and semi-trailers with a weight of less than 2,000 pounds.
Applying for Title, License 
Plates & Registration
Apply for title, license plates, and regis -
tration at any service center in Florida. 
The cost of your license plate will depend on the type and weight of your vehicle. Your vehicle must always have a current license plate and you must always have your vehicle’s registration when you are driving. If you buy a vehicle from a dealer in Florida, the dealer must apply for a certificate of title, certificate of registration and license plate for you. If you buy a vehicle from an individual, you must obtain the title from the indi -
vidual and apply for a certificate of title in your name.
You may apply for a certificate of title, 
certificate of registration, and license plate at the same time. You cannot get a license plate until you have a title to prove that you own the vehicle. All first time driver license applicants who hold an out-of-state license should apply for a Florida driver license before they regis -
ter their vehicle in Florida (many service centers will do both at the same time).
Renewal
Vehicle license plates and registrations must be renewed each year or biennially. Registrations expire at midnight on the birthday of the first owner listed on the registration form, except for:
 ◆mobile homes and semi-trucks/ 
semi-trailers renew yearly by December 31.
 ◆vehicles owned by companies and corporations and some CMVs renew yearly by June 30.
Registrations may be renewed up to 90 
days prior to the expiration date. Each time you renew, you must prove that you have the required insurance, unless it’s on file and electronically updated.

 The Off icial Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  39   ............................................................................Before You Drive—Your vehic Le
 ◆A “television-type receiver” that 
the driver can see.
 ◆Headsets/headphones worn by 
driver while operating a vehicle.
Read your vehicle owner’s manual! It's an excellent resource 
for information specific to your vehicle, such as: types of fluids your car requires, what dashboard warning lights mean, your car service intervals and more.
Air Bags
Air bags are designed to work with safety 
belts to protect occupants during a collision. Air bags are NOT a replace -
ment for wearing a safety belt .
Advanced Driver Assistance 
Systems (ADAS)
It’s important to understand that some 
driver assistance technologies are designed to warn you if you’re at risk of an impending crash, while others are designed to take action to avoid a crash. Be sure to review your vehicle’s owner’s manual for information on your vehicle’s technology and safety features.
COLLISION WARNING SYSTEMS
Collision Warning Systems only provide 
warnings to drivers and do NOT  take 
action to avoid a crash.
 ◆ Blind Spot Warning systems  
alert drivers with an audio or visual 
warning if there are vehicles in adjacent lanes that the driver may not see when making a lane change.
 ◆ Forward Collision Warning 
systems monitor your vehicle’s speed, the speed of the vehicle in front of it and the distance be -tween the vehicles. If the vehicle gets too close to the vehicle ahead, the system will warn the driver of an impending crash.
 ◆ Lane Departure Warning systems 
monitor lane markings and alerts the driver when it detects that the vehicle is drifting out of its lane.
 ◆ Rear Cross Traffic Warning alerts 
the driver of potential collisions, while in reverse, that may be outside the view of the backup camera.
COLLISION INTERVENTION SYSTEMS
Collision Intervention Systems are 
designed to take action to avoid a crash.
 ◆ Automatic Emergency Braking 
systems apply the vehicle’s brakes 
automatically in time to avoid or mitigate an impending forward crash with another vehicle.
 ◆Blind Spot Intervention systems monitor for vehicles in the driver’s blind spot using rear-facing cameras or proximity sensors. If the driver ignores the blind spot warning, and starts to change to a lane where there’s a vehicle, the system activates and automatically applies light braking pressure, or provides steering input to guide the vehicle back into the original lane. 
 ◆Pedestrian Automatic Emergency Braking systems  
use information from forward sensors to detect a pedestrian in the vehicle’s path. The system will provide automatic braking if the driver has not acted to avoid a crash.
 ◆Rear Automatic Braking  uses 
sensors, like parking sensors and the backup camera, to detect 
40  ©2023 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
objects behind the vehicle. If a 
potential collision is detected while in reverse, it automatically applies the brakes if a crash is imminent.
DRIVING CONTROL ASSISTANCE 
 ◆ Adaptive Cruise Control automat -
ically adjusts the vehicle’s speed to keep a pre-set distance between it and the vehicle in front of it.
 ◆Lane Centering Assistance utilizes a camera-based vision system designed to monitor the vehicle’s lane position and auto -
matically and continuously apply steering inputs needed to keep the vehicle centered within its lane.
 ◆Lane Keeping Assistance systems use lane departure warning sensors to determine if the vehicle is about to unintentionally move out of its lane of travel. If so, the system activates and corrects the steering, brakes or accelerates one or more of the wheels, or does a combina -
tion of both, resulting in the vehicle returning to its intended lane of travel.
OTHER SYSTEMS
 ◆Automatic Crash Notification systems notify emergency respond -
ers that a crash has occurred and provide its location. In most cases, when the system detects that an air bag has deployed or that there’s been a dramatic and sudden deceleration, the system automati -
cally connects to an operator, who will then be able to communicate with the driver. The operator is also able to collect basic information from the vehicle, without driver input, to provide to emergency responders so they can easily locate the scene of the crash. ◆ Automatic High Beams automati -
cally switch the vehicle’s headlights 
between the lower beam and the higher beam, based on lighting conditions and traffic, when an oncoming vehicle approaches. This technology, also known as semi-  
automatic beam switching head -
lamps, uses photometric sensors or onboard cameras to detect when to switch between high and low beams.
 ◆Backup Cameras , or rearview 
video systems, helps prevent 
backover crashes. By providing  
an image of the area behind the vehicle, a backup camera helps  
the driver see behind the vehicle while in reverse. It’s important to remember that backup cameras are not a replacement for mirrors or turning around to look.
Additional information on ADAS is avail -
able at mycardoeswhat.org.
Brake Systems
Anti-lock brake system (ABS) prevents 
skidding and allows drivers to steer during an emergency braking situation. ABS can help improve vehicle stability, steering, and stopping capability. It is important to know if your vehicle has ABS because it will affect the way you should stop in an emergency situation. 
Drivers with ABS  need to press down 
hard on the brake pedal, hold it, and 
steer out of danger. In an emergency situation, the ABS automatically pumps the brakes at a faster rate than the driver could. Removing steady pressure from the brake pedal or pumping the brakes will disengage or “turn off” the ABS. 
 The Off icial Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  41   ............................................................................Before You Drive—Your vehic Le
Drivers with conventional brakes  must pump the brakes in order to stop in an 
emergency situation where traction is lost and the vehicle slides.
You can determine if the vehicle has ABS by looking for a lighted ABS symbol on  
the dashboard after starting the engine, checking the owner’s manual, or asking the 
dealer.
Bumper Height Requirements
Owners of automobiles and pickup trucks are required to have front and rear bumpers mounted within certain height levels. Height limitations are governed by the net ship -
ping weight of the vehicle, not the modified or altered weight. The maximum allowable height between the pavement and bottom of the front and rear bumper are:
Vehicle Weight Front Rear
Cars < 2,500 lbs. 22 in. 22 in.
Cars 2,500–3,499 lbs. 24 in. 26 in.
Cars ≥ 3,500 lbs. 27 in. 29 in.
Trucks < 2,000 lbs. 24 in. 26 in.
Trucks 2,000–3,000 lbs. 27 in. 29 in.
Trucks 3,000–5,000 lbs. 28 in. 30 in.
Emissions Control Devices
It is illegal to tamper with, remove, or cause not to work, any pollution control device on your vehicle. Tampering can cause damage your vehicle, increased air pollution, lower gas mileage, less vehicle efficiency and breathing difficulties.

White Stop Lines
Stop lines show where you must stop for a stop sign or red 
light. You must stop your vehicle before any part of it crosses the line before the crosswalk.
Marked Crosswalks
Marked with solid white lines and sometimes filled with white diagonal or perpendicular lines. Shows where pedestrians should cross. Motorists must always yield the right-of-way to pedestrians in a crosswalk. 
Turn Lanes
Arrows are often used with white lane lines to show which turn may be made from the lane.
 ◆Lane is marked with a curved arrow and the word 
“ONLY”: you must turn in the direction of the arrow.
 ◆Lane is marked with both a curved and straight arrow: you may either turn or go straight.
 ◆Two-way roadway with center lane: drivers from either direction may use the center lane for left turns; you must not use for passing.
Reversible Lanes
Some highways have reversible traffic lanes to help handle 
rush-hour traffic. The direction of traffic is normally reversed at set times each day. These lanes are marked with special pavement markings, lane signals, and signs.
Bicycle Lanes
 ◆Exclusive bike lane. Solid white lines separate these 
bike lanes from motor vehicle travel lanes. Often marked with bike lane signs/symbols.
 ◆Shared-use lane.  Marked with “sharrows.” These 
markings alert motorists that bicyclists may use the entire lane, indicate to bicyclists where to ride, and discourage bicycling in the wrong direction.
Motorized vehicles are not allowed to drive in bike lanes; they 
may cross over them when turning at intersections, but only when no bicyclists are present in the bike lane. For additional bicycle safety information, see page 81 .

Traffic Signals
Traffic signals are placed at intersections to keep traffic moving and 
to help prevent crashes. Drivers, pedestrians, and bicycle riders must obey these signals except when an officer is directing traffic. If a traffic signal is out of order and law enforcement is not present, treat the light/intersection as a four-way stop sign (see Power Outage on page 79).
Steady Signal Lights
RED LIGHT
 ◆Come to a complete stop at the stop line. Remain stopped 
until the light turns green.
 ◆Don’t stop too far away from the stop line. Some signals change only when sensors detect vehicles at the stop line.
 ◆After stopping, you may turn right if there is not a NO TURN ON RED sign and the way is clear.
 ◆You may turn left from a one-way street onto a one-way street that has traffic moving to the left.
 ◆Before turning, you must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians in the crosswalk and oncoming traffic.
 ◆Running (driving through) a red light is against the law and is extremely dangerous!
YELLOW LIGHT
 ◆Warning—the light is changing to red.
 ◆Stop if you can safely do so. It is extremely dangerous to be in an intersection when the light turns red.
GREEN LIGHT
 ◆Go, but only if the intersection is clear.
 ◆Yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk and vehicles in the intersection.
 ◆Approach at a speed that will allow you to slow down if the light changes.
 ◆When turning left, you must yield to oncoming traffic and pedestrians.

Construction/Maintenance Signs & Signals
Traffic control devices are used in road construction and maintenance work areas to 
direct drivers and other road users safely through the work site. Be prepared to reduce your speed and use caution when directed to do so by a sign, flagger, or law 
enforcement officer. Failure to do so is illegal and is dangerous to those working in 
the construction zone. 
Construction and Maintenance Signs. The signs—usually diamond shaped and/or 
orange in color—notify drivers of unusual or potentially dangerous conditions near 
work areas.
Channeling Devices. These include barricades, vertical panels, drums and cones. 
These devices alert drivers of unusual or potentially dangerous conditions on the roadway and in work zones. These devices may be equipped with warning lights at nighttime and stripes on barricades and panel devices slope downward in the direc -
tion traffic must travel.
Flashing Arrow Panels. Used both during the day and at night to give advance 
warning and directional information when it is necessary to move to another lane.
Flaggers. People who work in roadway construction/maintenance zones to stop, 
slow, or guide traffic safely through the area. Flaggers wear bright colored/fluores -
cent vests or jackets and use red flags or signs to direct traffic.
Drawbridge Signs & Signals
Drawbridges are mechanical bridges over navigable waters that raise or turn to allow 
marine traffic to go under them.
Drawbridge Signal
 ◆Red. Come to a complete stop at the marked stop line. The bridge is in opera -
tion and the roadway is closed to all pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic.
 ◆Yellow. The light is about to turn red. Stop if you can safely do so. The bridge is 
about to start operation.
 ◆Green.  Proceed with caution.

 T he Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  55   ......................................................................................................Traffic co n T roLs
Flashing Yellow Signal.  When the yellow light is flashing, the 
drawbridge is in operation. Slow down and prepare to stop.
Gates.  Many drawbridges have gates with flashing red lights and 
bells. Stop when the lights begin to flash and before the gate 
lowers. It's against the law to drive around or under a gate—
either down or while being opened or closed—and it is extremely 
dangerous.
Pedestrian Signs & Signals
Pedestrian signals show words or pictures to indicate when it is safe—or not—to use the crosswalk.
WALK or Walking Person. You may begin to cross the street.DON’T WALK or Raised Hand. Never enter the crosswalk or 
begin crossing the street when the raised hand is flashing or solid. If you are already in the crosswalk when this signal begins flashing, quickly finish crossing the street.
Countdown Signal.  The countdown starts at the beginning of 
the DON’T START (flashing hand phase) and ends with a zero and 
a DON’T WALK (solid hand) phase. Once the countdown starts 
and the hand is flashing, it is no longer safe to enter the crosswalk.
Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacon. Push the button to activate 
the signal. Once the lights begin to flash and the approaching 
traffic stops, use the crosswalk. Motorists must stop and yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk.
Pedestrian Hybrid Beacon
 ◆When approaching a pedestrian signal with no light, if the 
intersection is clear, go.
 ◆If there is a yellow flashing light, slow down, because this light indicates that a pedestrian has activated the push button. Approach at a speed that will allow you to stop if the light changes.
 ◆If there is a yellow steady light, prepare to stop.
 ◆If there is a red steady light, stop for pedestrian in crosswalk.
 ◆If there is a red flashing light, proceed with caution. If no pedestrian is present and the intersection is clear, go.

Railroad Crossing Signs & Signals
When approaching a highway-railroad crossing, slow down and be 
ready to stop. Do not stop on the railroad tracks or within 15 feet of the crossing.
Any driver, bicyclist or pedestrian approaching a railroad-highway 
crossing must stop if:
 ◆the warning devices are flashing;
 ◆the crossing gate is lowered;
 ◆a human flagger is warning of an approaching train; and/or
 ◆an approaching train is clearly visible.
Advance Warning Sign.  This is usually the first sign you see when 
approaching a highway-railroad crossing.
Crossbuck Sign.  These are yield signs; you must yield the right-of-
way to trains. A sign below the crossbuck will show the number of 
tracks if there is more than one track.
Flashing Red Light Signals.  At many crossings, the crossbuck sign 
has flashing red lights and bells. When the lights begin to flash, stop 
immediately! A train is approaching.
Gates.  Many crossings have gates with flashing red lights and bells. 
Stop when the lights begin to flash and before the gate lowers 
across your road lane. It's against the law to drive around or under a 
crossing gate—either down or while being opened or closed.
Pavement Marking. Markings may be painted on the paved 
approach to a crossing before the stop line.
Dynamic Envelope.  White roadway markings in the shape of con -
necting X’s used to visually highlight the danger zone where road 
users should not stop. These markings indicate the clearance needed for trains to safely pass, as any object within the dynamic envelope 
has the potential to be struck when the train passes through.

 T he Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  57   ......................................................................................................Traffic co n T roLs
Remember:
 ◆Slow down when approaching railroad crossings.
 ◆Be prepared to stop especially when following buses or 
trucks; many are required to stop at railroad crossings even when gates are up/lights are not flashing.
 ◆If there is more than one track, make sure all tracks are clear before crossing.
 ◆In heavy traffic, make sure there is room for your vehicle on the other side of the track before crossing.
 ◆Trains are often traveling faster than they appear and they cannot stop quickly. Don’t try to “beat the train;” the train always wins.
School Zone Signs & Signals
School Sign.  You are near a school. Watch for children at all times,  
not just during school hours.
School Crossing. Slow down and watch for children crossing the 
road. Stop if necessary. Obey signals from any crossing guards.
Begin School Zone.  Do not exceed the school zone speed limit 
during indicated times or when light is flashing.End School Zone. Marks the end of a reduced speed school zone.School Bus Stop Ahead . Be prepared to stop. This sign is used to 
alert motorists of an upcoming school bus stop that may be unex -
pected or obscured by roadway geometry, such as a curve or hill.

 T he Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  59  DRIVING SAFETY
Getting Ready to Drive
Inspect Your Vehicle
Brakes:  Check to see that the pedal stays above the floor when you step on it. If the 
car pulls to one side when you brake or if you hear any scraping or squealing noises, 
your brakes may need to be repaired.
Lights:  Check often, replace burned- out bulbs and keep lenses clean.
Tires:  Inspect often for proper inflation/tire pressure, even tread wear and damage.
Windows and Windshields:  Keep the glass clean inside and out.
Rear Window:  If the rear window is covered by or treated with any material that 
makes it non-transparent, the vehicle must be equipped with side mirrors on both 
sides that allow the driver a rearview of at least 200 feet.
Before you start your engine:
 ◆Be sure vehicle is in park or neutral.
 ◆Adjust the seat so you can reach all controls.
 ◆Adjust all rear-view mirrors so that you can use them without having to lean 
forward or backward.
 ◆Move anything that blocks your view of mirrors or roadway.
 ◆Lock all car doors.
 ◆Fasten your safety belt and make sure all passengers do the same.
Backing Up
1. Check behind your vehicle before you get in. Children and small objects cannot be seen from the driver’s seat.
2. Place your right arm on the back of the passenger seat and turn around so that you can look directly through the rear window. 
 ◆Do not depend on your rear-view or side mirrors as you cannot see directly behind your vehicle. 
 ◆Don’t completely rely on cameras/alarms; they don’t always detect small children and animals.
3. Back up slowly; your vehicle is harder to steer while you are backing.
4. When possible, have someone outside the vehicle to help you back up.

Blind Spots
Blind spots are areas near the left and right rear corners 
of your vehicle that you can’t see in your rear-view mirrors or with your peripheral vision.
Before you move to change lanes on a highway, pass on 
any road, or make certain turns, turn your head to make sure these areas are clear. Do not drive in someone else’s blind spot. Move forward or drop back so that the other driver can see you. The larger the vehicle, the larger the blind spots. Large trucks and SUVs have blind spots close to the rear of the vehicle that cannot be seen in rear-view mirrors (see No Zones on page 82).
Braking Distance
Perception Distance 
How far your vehicle travels—in favorable weather conditions—from the time your eyes see a hazard until your brain recognizes it. Perception distance can be affected by mental and physical conditions, medication, as well as visibility and the hazard itself. The average perception time for an alert driver is ¾ second to 1 second.
Reaction Distance 
How far you will continue to travel after seeing the hazard until you physically hit the brakes. The average driver has a reaction time of ¾ second to 1 second. At 50 MPH, this accounts for 55 feet traveled.
Braking Distance 
How far your vehicle travels—in favorable weather conditions— while you are brak -
ing. At 50 MPH, on dry pavement and with good brakes, it can take about 158 feet.
 ◆High speeds greatly increase stopping distances and severity of crashes. The 
faster you drive, the greater the impact or striking power of your vehicle.
 ◆Doubling the speed means the braking distance and impact are 4 times greater.
 ◆Tripling the speed means the braking distance and impact are 9 times greater. 
 ◆Quadrupling the speed means the braking distance and impact are 16 times greater.
Total Stopping Distance
The total minimum distance your vehicle will travel (perception distance, reaction 
distance, and braking distance) until your vehicle comes to a complete stop. At 50 MPH, you will travel a minimum of 268 feet...nearly the length of a football field.
Blind Spots  
(approximate)
 T he Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  61   ............................................................................................................Driving sa fe T Y
Following Distances
Rear-end collisions are almost always 
caused by drivers following too closely. Maintaining a large enough following 
distance (the space between you and the 
vehicle in front of you) greatly helps avoid a collision with the vehicle in front of you. The more distance between your vehicle and others, the more time you have to 
react. Keep a minimum following dis -
tance of four seconds during favorable 
weather and traffic conditions. (Increase following distance during unfavorable 
weather or traffic conditions.)
How to determine a safe  
following distance:
1. Watch when the rear of the vehicle 
ahead passes a stationary marker such as a sign or light pole.
2. Count the seconds it takes you  
to reach the same marker: “One-thousand-one, one-thousand-  
two, one-thousand-three, one-thousand-four.”3. If you pass the stationary marker 
before counting to one-thousand- four, you are following too closely.
4. Reduce speed and then count 
again at another stationary point. Repeat until you are following no closer than four-seconds.
Increase your following distance in these 
situations:
 ◆Rain or when roads are wet.
 ◆Low visibility—dusk, dawn, 
nighttime, fog, etc.
 ◆When being passed (more space in front of your vehicle so the pass can be completed safely).
 ◆Carrying a heavy load or pulling a trailer. (The extra weight makes it more difficult to stop quickly/steer correctly.)
 ◆When stopped behind another vehicle on an incline; it may roll back before moving forward.

62  ©2023 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
 ◆When following:
 ◆Motorcycles. The chances of a 
motorcyclist falling are greater on wet or gravel roads, or metal surfaces such as bridges. You will need extra stopping/steering distance to avoid hitting the motorcycle/rider.
 ◆Emergency vehicles. It's against the law to follow a fire truck responding to an emergency closer than 500 feet.
 ◆Vehicles required to come to a stop at railroad crossings, such as city and school buses and vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
 ◆Vehicles with a blocked rear view. Drivers of trucks, buses, vans, or vehicles pulling trailers may not be able to see your vehicle when you are directly behind them.
If your vehicle is being followed too 
closely, slow down and keep to the right.
FOLLOWING DISTANCE FOR TRUCKS 
A truck or any vehicle towing another 
vehicle must not follow within 300 feet of another truck or another vehicle in tow. This law does not apply to overtak -
ing and passing or within cities or towns.Intersections
Many intersections are marked with stop lines to show where you must come to a complete stop. After a complete stop, 
you must yield the right-of-way to traffic 
already in the intersection and to pedes -
trians and bicyclists. Move forward only when the road is clear.
Always look both ways for pedestrians or 
bicyclists at an intersection. Remember to look right before making a right turn.
Vehicles proceed through the intersection 
in the order they arrived; the first vehicle 
to reach the intersection should move 
forward first. If vehicles arrive at approxi -
mately the same time, each driver must yield to the drivers on their right. At a 
two-way stop, the turning vehicle yields 
to the vehicle going straight.
Driveways
Drivers entering a road from a driveway, alley, or roadside must yield to vehicles already on the main road, as well as to 
pedestrians and bicyclists on the side -
walk or in bike lanes.
Open Intersections
An open intersection is one without 
traffic control signs or signals. When you enter an open intersection, you must 
yield the right-of-way if:
 ◆a vehicle is already in the 
intersection;
 ◆you enter or cross a state highway from a secondary road;
 ◆you enter a paved road from an unpaved road; or
 ◆you plan to make a left turn and a vehicle is approaching from the opposite direction.

 T he Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  63   ............................................................................................................Driving sa fe T Y
Roundabouts
A roundabout is a circular intersec -
tion with no traffic signal.
 ◆Roundabouts travel in a 
one-way, counter-clockwise direction.
 ◆Drivers entering the round -
about must yield to traffic 
already in the roundabout.
 ◆If there is no traffic, you may 
enter without yielding.
 ◆Do not change lanes in the 
roundabout.
 ◆Do not stop in a roundabout.
 ◆Signal before exiting the 
roundabout.
MULTI-LANE ROUNDABOUTS. 
These have the same rules as single-lane 
roundabouts, however you will need to choose the proper lane prior to entering the roundabout. To go straight or right, 
use the right lane. To go straight or left, 
and to make a U-turn, use the left lane.
Prior to entering or exiting the round- 
about, drivers must yield to pedestrians in the crosswalks. Bicyclists may take the lane in the roundabout or use the sidewalk.
Limited Access Highways
Limited access highways—also called expressways, interstate highways, turn -
pikes, toll roads, and freeways—are 
multiple-lane roads with no stop signs, 
traffic lights, or railroad crossings. Pedestrians, hitchhikers, bicycles,  
animal-drawn vehicles, and motor-driven cycles/motor scooters (with 150 cubic centimeter displacement or less) are not allowed on limited-access highways.Entering & Leaving Limited 
Access Highways
All limited access highway entrances have 
three basic parts: an entrance ramp, an acceleration lane, and a merging area.
WHEN ENTERING A LIMITED ACCESS 
HIGHWAY:
1. On the entrance ramp, begin checking for an opening in traffic. Signal your intent to merge onto the highway.
2. Increase your speed as the ramp straightens into the acceleration lane. 
3. Adjust your speed to safely merge into traffic when you reach the end of the acceleration lane.
4. Merge into traffic when you can do so safely. You must yield the right-of-way to traffic on the highway. Do not stop in the acceleration lane unless traffic is too heavy and there is no space for you to enter safely.

64  ©2023 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
WHEN LEAVING A LIMITED ACCESS 
HIGHWAY:
1. Get into the exit lane. Most exits 
are from the right lane.
2. Activate your turn signal to show your intention to exit.
3. Slow down in the deceleration lane. Check the posted safe speed for the exit ramp.
4. Don’t make last-minute turns into an exit. If you pass your exit, you must go to the next one.LIMITED ACCESS HIGHWAY SAFETY 
REMINDERS
 ◆Plan ahead. Know your exits. In 
Florida, exits match the mile markers on the highway.
 ◆Drive in the right lane and pass on the left. While in the right lane, watch for cars entering the highway. Adjust your speed or move over so they can enter safely.
 ◆Never drive across or park on the median.
 ◆Never stop on the pavement, shoulder, or connecting ramp except in an emergency. If your vehicle breaks down, you must move it completely of the pave -
ment. (No more than six hours.)

 T he Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  65   ............................................................................................................Driving sa fe T Y
 ◆Don’t follow too closely. Rear-end 
collisions are the greatest danger on limited access highways.
 ◆Never back up on an entrance ramp or exit ramp. The ONLY exception to this is if you see a WRONG WAY or DO NOT ENTER sign or red reflectors on lane lines. You must back up or turn around.
 ◆Stop driving when you feel tired. Do not risk falling asleep at the wheel.
 ◆Obey the Move Over law.
Move Over Law
The Move Over Law protects law enforce -
ment officers, emergency workers, tow 
truck drivers, sanitation workers, utility 
workers and road and bridge mainte -
nance or construction vehicles displaying 
warning lights stopped along roadways while performing their jobs. 
It also protects disabled motor vehicles 
that are stopped and displaying warning lights/hazard lights, using emergency 
flares or signage or where one or more 
persons are visibly present.
On a Multi-Lane Roadway
 ◆You must vacate the lane closest to 
the stationary law enforcement, emergency vehicle, tow truck, sanitation, or utility vehicle. (Signal your intention to change lanes.)
 ◆If you cannot move over safely, you must slow down to a speed of 20 MPH below the posted speed limit.
 ◆Drivers who are not in the lane closest to the stationary vehicle should be prepared to allow those who are about to move over into their lane.On a Two-Lane Roadway
 ◆You must slow down to 20 MPH below the posted speed limit.
 ◆If the speed limit is 20 MPH or less, 
you must travel at 5 MPH.
Parking
When parking on a public road, move as 
far away from traffic as possible. If there is a roadside shoulder, pull as far onto it 
as you can.
Always park on the right side of the road, 
unless it is a one-way street. Park paral -
lel to the curb in the direction of traffic, 
with right-hand wheels parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb or side of roadway. Set the parking brake and shift 
to Park (automatic transmission) or 
Reverse (manual transmission). Turn off the engine and lock the vehicle. Florida law requires that you take the keys out 
of your vehicle before leaving it.
Always check traffic around you before 
getting out of a vehicle so you do not open 
your door into a bicyclist or another vehicle.
Before you drive from a parked position, 
make sure the roadway is clear. Give the proper turn signal and yield to other traffic before pulling away from the curb.
Parking on Hills
1. Turn your wheels so that if your 
car starts to move, it will roll away 
from traffic or into the curb.
2. Set the parking brake.
3. Automatic transmission: put gear 
shift in Park. Manual transmission: 
shift to Reverse (downhill) or First 
(uphill).
4. Turn vehicle off.

Straight-in Parking
When properly parked, the vehicle 
should be centered inside the space with no part of the vehicle extending into the traffic lane.
It’s Against the Law to Park 
 ◆On crosswalks
 ◆On sidewalks
 ◆In bicycle lanes

Passing
1. You must activate your signal 
before moving into the left lane to let others know that you are about to change lanes to pass.
2. Stay a safe distance behind the vehicle you want to pass. The closer you get, the less you can see ahead.
3. Before you pull out to pass, check blind spots and make sure you have plenty of time and room to pass.
4. Tap your horn (day) or flash your headlights (night) to let the other driver know you are passing.
5. Do not return to the right side of the road until you can see the tires of the vehicle you passed in your rear-view mirror. Signal when you are about to return to your lane.
6. You must return to the right side of the road before coming within 200 feet of any approaching vehicle.
Do not attempt to pass more than one 
vehicle at a time. Passing multiple vehi -
cles is dangerous.
Stay within the speed limit. It’s illegal to 
exceed the speed limit while passing.
You Must Not Pass:
 ◆where there is a single or double-  
sided solid line dividing lanes; ◆when the double-sided yellow line is solid in your lane;
 ◆in Do Not Pass and No Passing 
zones;
 ◆on hills or curves where you can’t see at least 500 feet ahead;
 ◆within 100 feet of an intersection, 
bridge, viaduct, tunnel, or railroad crossing;
 ◆when a school bus is stopped and 
has its warning flashers on and stop sign extended; and
 ◆at crosswalks where a vehicle has stopped to allow a pedestrian to cross.
Being Passed
Do not increase your speed when you 
are being passed. Move to the right side of your lane to give passing drivers more 
room and a better view of the road 
ahead.
*Florida Law states that a driver must 
move out of the left lane when being 
overtaken from behind by another vehicle traveling at a faster speed.
Passing on the Right
Passing on the right is only legal when 
there are two or more traffic lanes mov -
ing in the same direction or the vehicle 
you are passing is making a left turn.
Stay a safe distance behind the vehicle you want to pass. The closer you get, the less you can see.

Right-of-Way
Right-of-way rules tell you who goes first 
and who must wait in different condi -
tions. The law says who must yield (give 
up) the right-of-way. 
Every driver, motorcyclist, moped 
rider, pedestrian, and bicyclist must 
do everything possible to avoid a crash.
Speed Limits
Speed limits show the fastest speed you may drive under favorable conditions. You are responsible for adjusting your 
driving speed to the weather, roadway, 
and traffic conditions. For example, during a storm, you should drive slower than the posted speed limit. The safest speed is the one that allows you to 
have complete control of your vehicle 
and avoid collisions.
Obeying the speed limit reduces the 
probability and severity of crashes. The faster you drive, the greater the impact or striking power of your vehicle:
 ◆When you double the speed of a 
car, you increase its force of impact four times.
 ◆When you triple the speed of a car, you increase its force of impact nine times.
Speeding is against the law. You must 
obey the speed limit and you are respon -
sible for knowing the speed limit when you are driving. Observe and obey 
posted speed limit signs. 
The “speeding buffer” is a myth. You 
are not allowed to drive up to 10 MPH over the speed limit and may receive a citation for speeding. Florida Standard Speed Limits
 ◆School Zones: 20 MPH
 ◆Municipal, Business, or Residential Area: 30 MPH*
 ◆Streets and Highways: 55 MPH*
 ◆Limited Access Highways: 70 MPH
*Maximum speed except where otherwise posted.
Driving too slowly is also against Florida 
law. You must not drive so slowly that you block or delay traffic moving at 
normal, safe speeds. You should drive 
with the flow of traffic, within the speed limit. When driving slower than the flow of traffic, keep right so others may safely pass. On highways, when the posted 
speed limit is 70 MPH, the minimum 
speed limit is 50 MPH.
Stopping
Stopping suddenly is dangerous and can be caused by not paying attention to the traffic flow or following others too 
closely. Sudden stops make it difficult 
for drivers behind you to avoid a rear-end collision. 
To ensure you are stopping smoothly:
 ◆Check all mirrors and blind spots 
for traffic to the rear.
 ◆Release the accelerator to allow the vehicle to slow. Press the brake 
pedal to activate brake lights and 
use a steady pressure.
Traffic Lanes
 ◆On a two-lane highway you must 
always drive in the right lane 
unless you are overtaking and 
passing (where permitted).
 T he Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  69   ............................................................................................................Driving sa fe T Y
 ◆If the road has four or more lanes 
with two-way traffic, drive in the right lanes except when overtaking 
and passing.
 ◆The center lane of a three-lane or 
five-lane highway is used only for turning left.
HOV Lanes
Some highways reserve the left lane for 
vehicles with two or more occupants or hybrid/low emission vehicles (LEV). LEVs 
require a decal and completion of 
FLHSMV Form 83027. High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes are identified by signs/diamond pavement symbols, and are separated by a striped buffer zone. 
Vehicles may enter and exit the HOV lane 
only at designated points.
Red Reflectors on Lane Lines
Red reflectors on lane lines always mean you are facing traffic the wrong way and could have a head-on collision.
 ◆If you see red reflectors facing  
you on the lane lines, you are on 
the wrong side of the road. Turn around or get into the proper lane immediately!
 ◆If you see red reflectors on the edge lines of the road, you are going the wrong way on an entrance or exit ramp. Pull over immediately! Turn around when it is safe to do so.Turning
 ◆You must use vehicle directional signals or hand signals to show other drivers that you are turning.
 ◆Turn signals are required by law when changing lanes or overtaking a vehicle.
 ◆You must give a turn signal at least 100 feet BEFORE making your turn.
 ◆It's against the law to use your directional signals to tell drivers behind you that they can pass.
 ◆Hand signals must be given from the left side of the vehicle.
* Note: Bicyclists may extend right hand and arm 
horizontally from right side of bicycle for right 
turn.
Turning a corner may seem to be a simple 
task, but many traffic crashes are caused by drivers who do not turn correctly.
1. Slow down to a safe turning 
speed.
2. Move into the correct lane as you near the intersection. 
3. Activate your turn signal at least 100 feet before making your turn. Allow time for drivers around you to see your signal before you move.
4. Obey any NO TURN ON RED or STOP HERE signs.

5. Yield to bicyclists when crossing a bike lane and to pedestrians who may be 
crossing your path.
6. Stay in the proper lane during your turn. Yield the right-of-way to vehicles and 
bicycles coming from the opposite direction.
7. Finish your turn in the proper lane. Turn right into the right lane of the roadway entered. A left turn may be completed in any lane lawfully available—or safe—for the desired direction of travel.
Never make last minute turns. If you reach an intersection where you wish to turn 
and are not in the proper lane, drive to the next intersection and then make the turn from the proper lane.
Three-Point Turns
Sometimes you will need to turn around in a very small space. Use a three-point turn only if the road is too narrow for a 
U-turn and you can’t go around the block.
To make a three-point turn:
1. Move as far right as possible, check 
traffic, and signal a left turn. Turn the steering wheel sharply to the left and move forward slowly. Stop at the curb.
2. Shift to reverse, turn your wheels sharply to the right, check traffic, and back your vehicle to the right curb.
3. Shift the vehicle into drive and pull forward carefully.
Never make a three-point turn or a U-turn 
on a curve, a hill, the highway, or where there is a sign that prohibits U-turns.

Animals
There may be times when an animal suddenly runs in front of your vehicle. Do not 
swerve into oncoming traffic or off the roadway to avoid hitting the animal. This can result in a more serious crash than if your vehicle collided with the animal.
To reduce your chances of colliding with an animal:
 ◆Use caution when driving at dawn and dusk; this is when animals are most 
active.
 ◆Be extra alert when driving on roadways marked with animal crossing signs and near woods and water.
 ◆Scan the sides of the road and watch for the reflection of your headlights in the eyes of animals.
 ◆Deer/vehicle crashes occur most often from October to December.
If an animal is present:
 ◆Slow down when approaching animals that are standing near the roadway, they may bolt out or change direction.
 ◆Flash your headlights to warn other drivers when animals are spotted on or near the road.
 ◆If you have time to avoid hitting an animal, reduce your speed, tap your brakes, and sound your horn. Deer tend to fixate on headlights so flashing them may cause the animal to freeze. If there are no vehicles close behind you, brake hard without locking your wheels.
 ◆If collision is inevitable, do not swerve to avoid the animal. Keep your vehicle under control and on the roadway.
 ◆Report the crash to the law enforcement if it involves a large animal such as a bear, deer, or farm animal.
Low Visibility
Smoke from wildfires and controlled burning, fog and heavy rain will affect your 
ability to see. When driving in low visibility conditions:
 ◆You must turn on your headlights. Parking lights are not a substitute.
 ◆Drive with lights on low beam. High beams will reflect off the fog and impair 
visibility even more.
 ◆Turn on your headlights when you turn on your windshield wipers.
 ◆Use wipers and defrosters for maximum visibility. Sometimes it's difficult to determine if poor visibility is due to fog or moisture on the windshield.
 ◆Use the right edge of the road or edge lines and center lines as visual guides.

 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
 ◆Eliminate all distractions in your vehicle. Turn of the radio, cell phone, etc.
 ◆Watch out for slow-moving and parked vehicles.
 ◆Keep your windshield and head- lights clean to reduce glare and increase 
visibility.
Rain
When you turn on your windshield wipers, turn on your headlights.
Slow down! Roads become slick during rainstorms and especially if it has not rained 
in a while (oil build-up on the highway). Wet road conditions will increase your brak -
ing/stopping distance, so be sure to increase your following distance.
Hydroplaning happens when your vehicle slides on top of a thin layer of water 
between your tires and the road. When your tires are not touching the road, you can easily lose control and skid. Tires with low air pressure or bad tread increase the risk of hydroplaning (see page 79) —and so does speeding.
Brakes often become wet after driving in heavy rain. They may pull to one side or the o
ther, or they may not hold at all. If this happens, slow down and gently push on the 
brake pedal until your brakes are working again.
If you come to a flooded roadway, turn around and find another route. Do not 
attempt to drive through the water! It's impossible to determine the depth or current and your vehicle could become submerged or swept away.
Night Driving
High beam headlights can reveal objects up to a distance of at least 450 feet and are most effective for speeds 
faster than 25 MPH.
At night, glare from oncoming cars can reduce your vision.
 T he Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  73   ......................................................................................sPe cia L  Driving siTu aTi ons
You will need to drive with extra care at night. You can’t see as far ahead and the glare 
from oncoming traffic can reduce your vision even more. Florida law says you must:
 ◆Use headlights between the hours of sunset and sunrise.
 ◆Not use high beam headlights within 500 feet of an oncoming vehicle; use low 
beam headlights.
 ◆Not use high beam headlights within 300 feet of the vehicle ahead of you; use low beam headlights.
 ◆Not drive using only parking lights in place of headlights.
 ◆Turn on your parking lights at night when parking on a roadway or shoulder outside of cities and towns.
Guidelines for driving at night:
 ◆Avoid “over driving” your lights (driving too fast for what you can see).
 ◆High beam headlights can reveal objects up to a distance of 450 feet and are most effective for speeds faster than 25 MPH.
 ◆When leaving a brightly lit area, drive slowly until your eyes adjust to the darkness.
 ◆Don’t look directly at oncoming headlights. Use lane lines as visual guides and look quickly to check the other vehicle’s position every few seconds.
 ◆Drive as far to the right as you can if a vehicle with one light comes toward you; it could be a vehicle with a missing headlight.

 T he Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  75  HANDLING EMERGENCIES
Defensive Driving
Defensive driving is using safe driving strategies to prevent crashes. This means that  
you alter your driving to fit the weather conditions, the way you feel, and the actions  
of other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Follow these steps to avoid crashes:
1. Look for possible danger. For example, if you see school zone signs, plan 
what you will do if a child runs or rides into the street.
2. Anticipate what another driver might do and make appropriate adjust-
ments. For example, you’ve noticed someone aggressively changing lanes as they approach you from the rear. You should anticipate that they will probably pass you and cut you off—slow down and be ready to brake, if necessary.
3. Use extra caution when approaching an intersection. Crashes happen at intersections more than any other place. 
4. If a crash is unavoidable:
 ◆It's better to swerve off the road than into oncoming traffic.
 ◆It's better to drive off the road than to skid off the road.
 ◆It is better to hit something that is not moving instead of a vehicle moving toward you.
 ◆Hitting a vehicle moving in the same direction as you is better than hitting a vehicle head-on.
 ◆Hitting a “soft object” like a garden hedge is better than hitting a solid object like a tree or post.
Interacting with Law Enforcement
Law enforcement is responsible for conducting traffic stops when they have reason -
able suspicion of a traffic violation or a criminal violation. A traffic stop can be a 
stressful experience for the driver, any passengers, and for the officer too. Knowing 
what to do during the stop will help ensure your safety and the safety of others.
When you see emergency lights behind you, it's important for you and your passen -
gers to stay calm and cooperate.Remember to:
1. Activate your turn signal and pull off or to the side of the roadway as soon as it 
is safe to do so.
2. Turn off your engine and any audio devices.
3.  Stay in your vehicle unless directed by the officer to exit.
4. Keep your hands on the steering wheel or in a visible location so they are easily observable.
76  ©2023 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
5. Turn on your interior lights if you 
are pulled over at night to assist with visibility. Officers may use a 
spotlight for additional visibility. 
During the day, if you have tinted windows, roll down all windows.
6. Follow all instructions the officer 
gives you or your passengers.
The officer may approach either side of 
the vehicle. When the officer approaches the vehicle, remember to:
1. Lower the corresponding window 
so you and the officer can better communicate.
2. Let the officer know if you have a weapon in the vehicle upon first contact.
3. Wait for the officer’s instructions before reaching for your driver’s license or vehicle documents.
When conducting the stop, the officer 
will typically:
 ◆Show their law enforcement 
credentials if they are not in uniform. If they do not show their credentials, you may ask to see them.
 ◆Explain why you were stopped/ask questions about your trip.
 ◆Ask for your driver’s license, proof of insurance, and vehicle registra -
tion. If the documents are out of your reach, tell the officer where they are and wait for the officer’s acknowledgment before reaching to retrieve the documents.In some cases, the officer may:
 ◆Ask you to exit the vehicle. In this case, keep your hands visible, exit the vehicle, and stand in a location as directed by the officer.
 ◆Impose a sanction such as a warning, traffic ticket which may include a fine, or arrest. The officer will typically explain whatever action is being taken. If they do not, you may ask them to do so.
 If you have questions, respectfully ask 
the officer to clarify. If you disagree with the officer’s decision or course of action, do not prolong the contact by arguing 
with the officer. Rather, you may seek to 
contest the decision in court through established legal channels. Your accep -
tance and signature on a traffic ticket is not an admission of guilt. However, the 
refusal to sign a traffic ticket may result 
in your arrest.
If you believe the officer acted inappro -
priately or have questions regarding 
their conduct you may request to speak to a supervisor. This is best done as soon 
as possible after the stop.
Following these procedures can help 
make a traffic stop a safe experience for 
all parties involved.

Your Responsibilities After 
a Crash
If you are involved in a crash that results 
in death, injury or property damage, it's your duty—required by law—to give information and render aid. Always remain calm.
1. Stop and call 911, *FHP (*347),  
or local law enforcement.
2. Turn on hazard lights.
3. If anyone is hurt, you must get 
help immediately!
4. If the crash is minor and your vehicle is blocking the flow of traffic, you must move it or have it moved.
5. Exchange vehicle, witness,  
and driver information (name, address, phone number, license plate number, driver license and insurance).
6. Take photos or sketch the scene, showing vehicle crash locations.
A law enforcement officer will complete 
a written report if the crash involves a charge of DUI or results in death, injury, or property damage to the extent a vehicle must be towed.
If the crash results in vehicle or property 
damage and does not require a law enforcement report, you must make a written report of the crash to FLHSMV within 10 days. (This can be done at flhsmv.gov .)
If you are in a crash with an unattended vehicle or other property, you must make every attempt to locate the owner and notify law enforcement. If you can’t locate the property owner, you must leave a note including your name, contact information, and license plate (registra -
tion) number.Stay at the Scene
It is against the law to leave the scene of a crash involving death, injury or prop -
erty damage.
HIT AND RUN PENALTIES
If you leave the scene and it results in:
 ◆Death:  1st degree felony, minimum 
4-year prison term.
 ◆Serious bodily injury:  2nd degree 
felony.
 ◆Injury:  3rd degree felony.
All of the above include losing your 
driver license for 3 years minimum.
Damage to a vehicle or other property 
which is driven or attended by any per -
son is a 2nd degree misdemeanor.
First Aid
If you come upon a crash, call 911 or *FHP (*347) and/or send someone for help. Don’t assume someone else has called; it’s better for emergency services to get multiple calls rather than none at all.
Do not put yourself in danger! Pull as far 
of the road as possible and turn your hazard lights on to alert others. Be careful when exiting your vehicle and stay out of traffic.

78  ©2023 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
If someone is injured, apply first aid. 
However, don’t move an injured person who may have a neck or spinal injury. 
Don’t attempt to remove the helmet of 
an injured motorcycle or bicycle rider.
Treat For Shock
Persons who have been injured may go into shock. When someone is in shock, all body functions slow down. Shock can be 
very serious and can cause death. Treat 
the injured for shock regardless of whether or not they appear to be in shock:
 ◆Keep the injured person calm.
 ◆Don’t give them anything to drink.
 ◆Have the person lie flat and elevate 
their legs.
 ◆Cover the person with blankets to hold body heat.
 ◆Maintain an open airway.
Emergency Scenarios
Avoiding Rear-End Collisions
To avoid striking the vehicle in front of 
you, keep at least four seconds following distance and increase following distance 
during unfavorable weather or heavy 
traffic. To lower the risk of someone running into the rear of your vehicle:
 ◆Check brake lights to make sure 
they’re clean and working properly.
 ◆Know what is going on around you. Use the rear-view and side mirrors.
 ◆Signal well in advance for turns, stops, and lane changes.
 ◆Avoid sudden stops; slow down gradually and smoothly.
 ◆Drive with the flow of traffic (within the speed limit). Driving too slowly can be dangerous.Breakdowns/Disabled Vehicles
1. You must move the vehicle so all four wheels are out of traffic lanes as soon as possible. If you can’t 
move it, you must have it moved 
as soon as possible.
2. If possible, park where the disabled vehicle can be seen for 200 feet in each direction.
3. Turn on your hazard lights.
4. Get all passengers out of the car on the side away from traffic.
5. Call *FHP (*347) or law enforce -
ment for assistance.
Emergency Braking
To stop in an emergency situation where 
traction is lost, drivers with conventional brakes should pump the brakes. Drivers 
with anti-lock brakes (ABS) must press 
down hard on the brake pedal, hold it, and steer out of danger. If the driver with ABS removes steady pressure from the brake pedal or pumps the brakes, the 
ABS will disengage or turn off.
Vehicles with: 
 ◆Four-wheel ABS  (passenger cars 
and some light trucks). Brake hard, 
steer, and keep constant pressure 
on the brake pedal.
 ◆Rear-wheel ABS (on some light 
trucks). ABS prevents the rear wheels from locking up so that the 
back end of the vehicle does not 
skid. The front wheels can still lock 
up and cause the driver to lose steering control. If this happens, let up on the brake pedal just 
enough to allow the front wheels  
to start rolling again to regain 
control.

Fire
1. Exit the vehicle.
2. Call 911 for assistance.
3. Attempt to extinguish the fire only 
if you have a portable extinguish -
er and the fire is small. NEVER apply water to a gasoline or diesel fire.
4. If you can’t extinguish the fire,  
get away from the vehicle! The fumes are toxic and an explosion is possible.
Jammed Gas Pedal
1. Take your foot of the gas pedal.
2. Press the clutch (manual trans -
mission) or shift into neutral (automatic transmission).
3. If necessary, press—don’t slam— brakes to slow the vehicle.*
4. Carefully steer to a safe place to stop.
*  Do not shut off engine unless #1 and #2 do not 
work to slow the vehicle. If you shut off your 
engine, you will lose the ability to steer the car.
Overcorrection
Overcorrection is excessive steering in 
reaction to an event or loss of control of a vehicle. It typically occurs when a motorist steers too sharply in an effort to avoid a collision or driving off of the roadway. It can result in a rollover crash or steering into oncoming traffic. Avoid overcorrecting! If you find yourself unintentionally leaving the roadway:
1. Stay calm.
2. Hold the wheel firmly.
3. Take your foot off the gas and do 
not slam on the brakes.
4. Steer the car where desired.5. If necessary, steer the car to a safe 
place and stop.
Power Outage
In circumstances where the power is out and traffic signals are not active, treat intersections as a four-way stop:
 ◆Vehicles move through the inter -
section in the order they arrived 
(first to arrive is first to move forward).
 ◆If multiple vehicles arrive at the same time, the driver on the left yields to the driver on the right.
Right Wheels Off Pavement
1. Take your foot of the gas pedal.
2. Hold the wheel firmly and steer in a straight line.
3. Brake lightly.
4. Wait until the road is clear. Turn back on the pavement at a slow speed (signal your intention).
Skidding/Hydroplaning
1. Take your foot off the gas pedal.
2. Do not use your brakes, if possible.
3. Turn the vehicle’s front tires in the direction you want to go (steer in the direction of the skid).
4. If you are about to hit something, see Emergency Braking on page 
78.
Stalled on Railroad Tracks
If your car stalls on the railroad tracks, 
get everyone out immediately and get away from the car!
If you are stalled at a railroad crossing 
and the warning lights begin to flash, 20 seconds is the minimal amount of time 
80  ©2023 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
that it takes a train to reach the grade 
after the warning lights begin flashing.
If a train is coming, run in a 45-degree 
angle away from the tracks, but in a direction toward the train; you will be 
less likely to be hit by your vehicle or 
debris from the collision. Call 911 or *FHP (*347).
EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM 
(ENS)
There is a blue ENS sign installed at every 
highway-rail grade crossing. This sign provides critical emergency contact information to reach the railroad respon -
sible if there is a problem at the crossing or if something is blocking the tracks.
Submerged Vehicle
If you crash into a pond, river, or other body of water, your vehicle will only float on the surface for 30–60 seconds. Get 
out of the vehicle immediately— do NOT 
call 911 until you are out of the vehicle!
1. Unbuckle your safety belt.
2. Roll the window down before the car sinks. If you are able to open the door, be aware that the car 
will immediately fill with water.
3. If you are unable to roll the 
window down, try to kick out a side window.There are many types of “escape tools” 
available that will quickly break a win -
dow. If you keep one of these in your 
vehicle, be sure it is within reach in case of an emergency.
Tire Blowout
1. Take your foot off the gas. Do not 
use the brakes.
2. Concentrate on steering.
3. Slow down gradually.
4. Brake softly when the car is under control.
5. Pull completely off the pavement/ roadway.
Vehicle Approaching in Your Lane
1. Sound horn and flash high beams.
2. Brake hard.
3. Steer to the side of the road.
Wet Brakes
1. Test brakes lightly.
2. Brakes may pull to one side or may not hold at all.
3. Dry brakes by driving slowly in low gear and applying brakes.
 Th e Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  81  SHARING THE ROAD
Bicyclists
In Florida, the bicycle is legally defined as a vehicle and has all of the privileges, 
rights, and responsibilities on public roads (except limited access highways) that a motor vehicle operator does.
Bicyclists may ride out of the bike lane into the travel lane for their own safety due 
to: narrow roads, to avoid obstacles or pavement hazards, or to prepare for a left turn. A bicyclist may use the full lane even while traveling below the speed of traffic if the lane is too narrow for both a car and bicycle to share.
Bicyclists may also ride on sidewalks, but they must yield to pedestrians on side -
walks and in crosswalks.
Rules for Motorists
1. Florida law requires that you give bicyclists a minimum of three feet of 
clearance and use caution/slow speed when driving next to or passing them.
2. On a two-lane road, pass a bicyclist as you would a slow-moving vehicle, and only when it is safe to do so.
3. At intersections, assume bicyclists are traveling straight unless they signal otherwise. Yield to bicycles as you would to any other vehicle.
4. When you must cross into a bike lane to make a turn, yield to any bicyclist and make your turn behind the bicyclist.
5. Do not follow a bicyclist too closely.
6. At night, avoid using high beam headlights when a bicyclist is approaching.
7. Before opening a car door, check for bicyclists who may be approaching from behind.
8. Avoid honking your horn and startling a bicyclist.
Rules for Bicyclists
1. Bicyclists must obey all traffic controls and signals.
2. If bicyclists are not traveling at the speed of other traffic, they must use the bike lane. If no bike lane is available, they must stay on the right-most side of the road.
3. Bicyclists may use the full lane when making a left turn, passing, avoiding hazards, or when a lane is too narrow for them and a car to share it safely.
4. When operating a bicycle on a one-way street with two or more traffic lanes, bicyclists may ride on the left-hand side of the road.
5. Bicyclists must use directional hand signals (see page 69) to show other 
drivers that they are about to turn.
82  ©2023 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
6. Bicyclists must never attach 
themselves or their bike to any vehicle on the roadway.
7. Whether riding on a sidewalk or 
crosswalk, bicyclists have all the rights and duties of a pedestrian. However, they must yield right-of-way to pedestrians and must give an audible signal before passing.
8. Between sunset and sunrise, bicyclists must have a white light visible from 500 feet on the front of their bicycle and a red reflector and a red light visible from 600 feet on the rear.
9. Bicyclists must have brakes which can stop their bike within 25 feet from a speed of 10 MPH.
10. All bicyclists and passengers under age 16 are required to wear helmets that meet federal safety standards.
11. If transporting a child under age four or who weighs 40 pounds or less, bicyclists must use a back -
pack/sling, child seat, or trailer designed to carry children.
12. Bicyclists must not leave a child  
in a seat or carrier when they are not in immediate control of the bicycle.
13. If riding with others, bicyclists may not ride more than two side-by-side unless it is a path or part of a roadway reserved for bicycles. They must ride single file if they are impeding traffic.
14. Bicyclists must not wear head -
phones/earbuds in both ears while bicycling on the roadway.
15. Do not ride a bicycle when under the influence of alcohol or drugs.Bicyclist Safety Tips
 ◆No matter your age, wear a helmet.
 ◆Keep both hands on the handlebars.
 ◆On the roadway, check behind you before changing lanes or moving 
notably within the lane.
 ◆Be seen. Wear neon/fluorescent 
colors when riding and something 
reflective.
 ◆Don’t text while biking.
Commercial Motor Vehicles
Sharing the road with commercial motor 
vehicles (CMVs) such as semi-trucks or travel buses means abiding by different 
rules and safety strategies.
Rules for Motorists
1. Stay out of the “No Zone.” CMVs 
have large blind spots in front, 
behind, and on both sides of the 
vehicle. Even though CMVs have 
several rear-view mirrors, other 
vehicles will be hidden from view if within the “No Zone”/blind spot.
2. Don’t tailgate; you’ll be in the rear 
blind spot and may collide with the CMV if it stops unexpectedly.
3. If you are stopped behind a CMV 
on an upgrade, leave space in case the CMV drifts back when it starts to move. Keep to the left in your lane so the driver can see your vehicle.
4. Don’t use high beam headlights when following a CMV at night. Bright lights will blind the driver when they reflect of the CMV’s large side mirrors.

84  ©2023 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
 ������������������������� ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
5. When a CMV is coming from the 
opposite direction, keep to the right to avoid a sideswipe crash.
6. CMVs often need to swing wide to the left in order to make a right turn. Do not drive between the CMV and the curb—they will not be able to see you.
7. Never cross behind a CMV that is preparing to back up or that is backing up. The size of most CMVs and trailers completely hide objects behind them from view.
Passing Commercial Vehicles
 ◆When passing a CMV, check to your front and rear, and move into the passing lane only if it is clear and safe to pass. You must signal that you are changing lanes, and let the CMV driver know you are passing by blinking your headlights.
 ◆Pass CMVs on the left side for maximum visibility. Complete your pass as quickly as possible so that you do not remain in the CMV’s blind spot.
 ◆Avoid cutting in too soon when passing a CMV. Large CMVs can’t stop as quickly as other vehicles. Be sure you can see the cab in your rear-view mirror before completing your pass. (CMV drivers may flash headlights to let you know it is OK to merge back into the lane.)
 ◆Avoid passing a CMV on a down -
grade; its weight and momentum will cause it to increase speed.
 ◆When a CMV passes you, keep to the right side of your lane. Do not speed up while the CMV is passing.
Emergency Vehicles
Motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians 
must yield the right-of-way to law enforcement vehicles, fire engines, and 
other emergency vehicles using sirens or 
flashing lights. Pull over to the closest edge of the roadway immediately and stop until the emergency vehicle has passed. Do not block intersections.
Funeral Processions
Motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians must yield the right-of-way to funeral processions. When the funeral lead vehi -
cle enters an intersection, the remaining vehicles in the funeral procession may follow through the intersection regard -
less of any traffic control devices. All vehicles in the procession should have 
their headlights on or may use flashing 
hazard lights as a signal to others not to drive between the funeral procession.

Golf Carts
You may only drive a golf cart on golf 
courses or roadways that are designated for golf carts. These roads will be marked with appropriate signs.
 ◆A golf cart must not be driven on  
a public road or street by anyone under the age of 18 unless they possess a valid learner's license or valid driver license. Drivers 18 years old or older must possesses a valid form of government-issued photo -
graphic identification.
 ◆Golf carts may not be operated AT ALL unless allowed by the specific county or city.
 ◆A golf cart must only be operated during the hours between sunrise and sunset, unless the local govern -
ment permits driving outside of those hours (additional equipment is required for night driving.)
 ◆You may cross state roads if the posted speed limit is 45 MPH or less and only at an intersection with a traffic control device.
 ◆You can drive a golf cart on a sidewalk only if it is at least 5 feet wide. You must yield to pedestrians.
 ◆All local and state traffic laws must be obeyed, including yielding the right-of-way.
Required Golf Cart Equipment
 ◆Efficient brakes
 ◆Rear-view mirror
 ◆Reliable steering
 ◆Front and rear red warning reflectors
 ◆Safe tiresChild passenger safety seats should 
not be used on golf carts or other 
low speed vehicles (LSVs). Car seats are not crash tested for LSVs and may not perform as designed. Refer to the specific car seat manufacturer for more information.
REQUIRED FOR NIGHT DRIVING
 ◆Headlights
 ◆Brake lights
 ◆Turn signals
 ◆Windshield
Low-Speed Vehicles
Low-speed vehicles (LSV) are four-wheeled vehicles with top speeds of 21–25 MPH. Golf carts can be converted to low-speed vehicles. You must have a valid driver license to operate an LSV, and the LSV must:
 ◆only be operated on streets with a 
posted speed limit is 35 MPH or less.
 ◆be equipped with headlamps, stop lamps, turn signals, tail lamps, reflectors, parking brakes, rear-view mirrors, a wind shield, safety belts, and a vehicle identification number.
 ◆be registered and properly insured 
(see page 23 and page 37) .
Motorcycles and Mopeds
Motorcycle and moped drivers have the 
same rights and duties as drivers of motor vehicles. Riders committing traffic violations may receive citations.
Rules for Motorists
 ◆You must not attempt to share a lane 
with a motorcycle. The motorcyclist is entitled to the entire lane.

 T he Official Florida Driver License Handbook —rev. 08/2023  87   ......................................................................................................sh aring Th e ro aD
 ◆Watch for motorcycles and look 
carefully before pulling into an intersection or changing lanes. 
 ◆It is difficult to gauge the speed of a 
motorcycle because they take up less field of vision which interferes with depth perception. They may appear to be much farther away than they really are.
 ◆Do not follow too closely behind  
a motorcycle because they have the ability to stop more quickly than other vehicles.
 ◆Motorcyclists often slow down  
by down-shifting or rolling of the throttle, thus not activating the brake light.
 ◆Never pass a motorcyclist with only a few feet of space. The wind gust force can cause the rider to lose control.
 ◆When your vehicle is being passed by a motorcycle, maintain your lane position. Do not speed up.
 ◆Maintain more than a four-second buffer zone between you and a motorcyclist, and increase space when there is: inclement weather, gusty winds, wet or icy roads, bad road conditions such as potholes, gravel roads, and railroad crossings.
 ◆Use your turn signals prior to changing lanes! This is one of the most important actions you can do to help motorcyclists stay safe.
Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) safety features may not  
detect motorcyclists or motorcycles. Be aware of your surroundings at all times and follow the tips above!Rules for Motorcycle/Moped 
Riders
 ◆You must be 16 years of age or 
older to operate a motorcycle or 
moped on a public road.
 ◆If under 18, you must hold a 
learner’s license for 12 months 
with no moving violation convic -
tions prior to the issuance of a 
Motorcycle Only license.
 ◆Operators of motorcycles must 
complete an approved motorcycle safety course and get a motorcycle endorsement on their driver license 
or a Motorcycle Only license.
 ◆Operators of mopeds must have a 
Class E driver license. A motorcycle endorsement is not required.
 ◆Operators of motorcycles must 
wear a helmet unless they are 21

with any portion of your vehicle overhanging the crosswalk.
4. You may not overtake or pass a 
vehicle that's stopped at a cross -
walk to allow a pedestrian to cross

that moment.

on red and look both ways for pedestrians in the crosswalk.

public transit buses traveling in the same direction that have signaled and 
are reentering the traffic flow from a 
specifically designated pullout bay.

School Buses
It is against the law for any driver to 
pass a school bus when the school bus displays a stop signal.
On a two-way street or highway, all 
drivers moving in either direction must stop for a stopped school bus that is picking up or dropping of children. You must remain stopped until the stop signal is withdrawn and all children are clear of the roadway.
If the highway is divided by a raised 
barrier or an unpaved median at least five feet wide, you do not have to stop if you are moving in the opposite direction of the bus. Painted lines or pavement markings are not considered barriers. You must always stop if you are moving in the same direction as the bus and you must remain stopped until the stop signal is withdrawn.
School Crossings
School zones and crossings provide students with a safe zone when they cross the road to and from school. School signs advise drivers of school zones and school crossings. 
Crossing guards are the first to enter and 
last to exit a crosswalk to indicate that pedestrians, especially children, are about to cross or are crossing. When children or school crossing guards are present in a crosswalk, you must yield and stop at the stop line and not in the crosswalk.
Slow Moving Vehicles
Farm vehicles designed for operation at speeds less than 25 MPH must display this sign on the rear when using public highways (not limited access/inter -
states). Also, these vehicles must only be operated during daylight hours unless equipped with the proper lights/reflec -
tors required for night driving.
Two Lane AND Multi-Lane Paved Across
Vehicles traveling in both directions MUST  stop.
Divided Highway
Unpaved space 5 ft+/raised median/physical barrier
Vehicles behind the bus MUST  stop. 
Vehicles traveling in the opposite 
direction must proceed with caution.

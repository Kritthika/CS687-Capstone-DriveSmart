## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Gathers quiz results from database
- Loads knowledge base from CSV files
- Retrieves state-specific driving rules

### 2. **Performance Analysis**
- Calculates score trends and patterns
- Identifies weak areas based on performance
- Determines study requirements

### 3. **RAG Implementation**
- **Retrieval**: Finds relevant study materials based on weak areas
- **Augmentation**: Combines performance data with knowledge base
- **Generation**: Uses AI to create personalized recommendations

### 4. **Study Plan Creation**
- Estimates study time needed
- Creates daily schedules
- Prioritizes weak areas
- Provides specific activities

## üìÅ Knowledge Base Structure

The AI agent uses the following data sources:

- **`quiz_questions_wa.csv`**: Question bank for analysis
- **`traffic_rules_wa.csv`**: Traffic regulations and rules
- **`state_rules/`**: State-specific driving laws
- **`database.db`**: User quiz history and performance

## üéì Study Topics Covered

- **Traffic Signs**: Recognition and meaning
- **Right of Way**: Intersection rules and priorities
- **Parking Rules**: Legal parking requirements
- **Speed Limits**: Speed regulations and zones
- **Lane Changes**: Safe merging and signaling
- **Emergency Procedures**: Accident response
- **Driving Under Influence**: Legal implications
- **Vehicle Operation**: Basic driving mechanics

## üîç Performance Levels

- **`passing`**: Score ‚â• 80 (ready for test)
- **`close_to_passing`**: Score 70-79 (needs minor improvement)
- **`needs_improvement`**: Score < 70 (requires significant study)

## üìà Improvement Trends

- **`improving`**: Recent scores higher than older scores
- **`stable`**: Consistent performance level
- **`declining`**: Recent scores lower than previous
- **`insufficient_data`**: Not enough attempts to determine trend
